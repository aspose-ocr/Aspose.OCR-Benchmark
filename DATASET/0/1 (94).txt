MILFORD AREA COMMUNICATION CENTER 

1996 

On January 1, 1996, the Town of Greenville became an 
official voting member of the Milford Area Communication 
Center bringing the total number of towns that we provide 
emergency dispatching services for six (6). 

Our call volume continued to increase as the towns 
continued to grow and the agencies became busier. An 
estimated 50,000 to 60,000 calls were handled during 1996. 
These included calls requiring police, ambulance, and/or fire 
department response as well as public works response and 
informational calls (directions, road conditions, etc.) 

The goal of the Milford Area Communication Center has 
been to consistently provide professional dispatching services 
to the agencies we serve, as well as to the citizens. This is best 
achieved by the cooperation of all those who are a part of the 
Communications Center, either as an employee or a member 
agency and we are continuing to work to better understand the 
needs of the communities. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Joan K. Wetherall 
Director
