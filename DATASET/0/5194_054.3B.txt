would seriously degrade the capabilities of a reposi-
tory at Yucca Mountain to isolate nuclear wastes. In
particular, assumptions about waste-package per-
formance, retardation processes along fractures, and
flow and transport through the saturated zone would
all become more significant if fracture flow were to
occur. To illustrate the effects of each of these items
on performance, the fracture-flow baseline case
represented by Figures 26 through 28 will be varied


independently for each of these items in the follow-
ing sections.

4.3.3 Effects of Waste-Package Containment on
	Fracture-Flow Releases
  Figure 29 shows total releases at the water table
caused by a flux of 5 mm/yr for 300- and 1000-yr
containment periods and for a progressively failing
containment period. If fracture flow occurs, a 300-yr


Figure 29. Comparative ratios to the EPA limits of total curies remaining below the water table for 100,000 yr based on 300- and
1000-yr waste packages and waste packages with exponentially increasing loss of containment; total flux assumed to be 5 mm/yr;
interacting water assumed to be 2.5% of the total flux; asterisk shows coincident (at the scale of this graph) cumulative releases at
10,000 yr for the 300- and 1000-yr waste packages; solid triangle shows cumulative releases at 10,000 yr for the exponentially
decaying waste packages.
