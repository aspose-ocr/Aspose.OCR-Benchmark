b. Poles.

   (1)	The length and class of pole to be used shall be determined on
	the basis or required antenna height, depth of pole setting ( for
	guidance, see Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 11-485-5),
	and the transverse load under maximum wind, snow, and ice loadings
	when supporting the ultimate weight of antenna(s) and equipment. The
	class of pole shall be determined by translating this maximum trans-
	verse load to an equivalent resistive moment based on loading 2 feet
	below pole top. Guys shall be installed, if necessary, for increased
	strength or margin of safety.

   (2)	Physical clearances, safety features, and grounding requirements
	shall be in accordance with the criteria described herein for
	towers.

c. Masts.

   (1)	Masts shall be designed in accordance with the criteria described
	herein for towers and poles, as applicable.

   (2)	Masts shall be mounted in a manner to permit installation,
	maintenance, and removal of antennas and fittings without undue
	hazard. Whenever practicable, masts should be so mounted as to
	permit lowering or tilting for maintenance.

   (3)	Reference drawings and specifications for a typical antenna mast
	suitable for supporting a VHF or UHF (of various types) and
	with mounting details are available on request from the Headquarters'
	Office of Computer Services and Telecommunications Management.

d. Hardened Antenna Facilities. Reference drawings and specifications for
   underground, hardened, and remotely controlled telescoping ("pushup")
   antenna structures and facilities for high frequency (HF) applications
   are available on request from the Headquarters' Office of Computer
   Services and Telecommunications Management.
