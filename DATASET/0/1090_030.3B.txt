			APPENDIX

	This Appendix contains the detailed results of element dissolution rates,
radioactivity release rates, and concentrations for the saturation-limited
and diffusion-limited dissolution model calculations. These results are for
the nominal parameter values listed in Table III. The results are given in
the following order: (1) spent fuel, saturation-limited model, (2) spent
fuel, diffusion-limited model, (3) high-level waste, saturation-limited model,
and (4) high-level waste, diffusion-limited model.
