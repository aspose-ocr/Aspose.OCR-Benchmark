is enough larger than that at the surface that a relatively rapid change
in acceleration ratio appears to be taking place in the first 60 metres
of depth. Velocity and displacement ratios (Figures 2-2 and 2-3) are
only slightly larger than those at the surface. Acceleration peaks are
usually those in the p-wave, whereas those for displacement are in the
surface wave. Peaks for velocity can be in either. Scatter in the
ratios from shot to shot for any station is greatest for acceleration
and least for displacement.

The surface intercept of the ELS fit to all three parameters is larger
than 1 because of the rapid change at shallow depth, as noted above.
It is in order to review station characteristics which account for these
differences.

Station 10 Prime has both the surface and bottom stations in
alluvium. The bottom station, at 61m, is well above the alluvium/
basalt interface at 312 m and the water table at 316 m.

Station 4 is in alluvium throughout the length of the hole. The
bottom, at 130.5 m, is 333 m above the alluvium/tuff interface,
and about 338 m above the water table. Thus, it is not clear why
there should be such a large difference in top/bottom ratios
between Stations 4 and 10 Prime.

Station 10 has the bottom canister at 342.6 m. This is 30.6 m
below the alluvium/basalt interface and 26.6 m below the water table.
Thus, it would be expected that the basalt around the bottom canister
would offer restraint which would cause the top/bottom ratio to
be large. This does not appear to be so, especially when compared
