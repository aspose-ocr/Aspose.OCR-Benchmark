3.0 VIBRATORY GROUND MOTION HAZARD

The probability that the peak acceleration (A) is greater than some specified
value (a) can be fundamentally represented by the total probability theorem


where P indicates probability, A > a is the event whose probability is sought, and
M and R are the continuous, independent random variables of magnitude and
distance which influence A. The probability that A > a will occur can be
calculated by multiplying the conditional probability of A > a (given m and r)
times the probabilities of m and r, and integrating over all the possible values of
m and r.

In describing the seismicity of the sources, we are hindered by incomplete and
inaccurate historical data that are limited to a short time span. Reliance on
frequency data alone can result in erroneous conclusions. For this reason, we
base our analysis on geological and seismological data in order to increase the
reliability and predictability of the seismicity.

In the overall approach, each fault system is divided into a series of segments of
equal seismicity. Within each segment, earthquakes are assumed to occur at
random as a Poisson process. The distribution of these events, with respect to
magnitude, is consistent with a truncated exponential distribution. Fault rupture
is taken into account through an empirical relationship between magnitude and
fault length. The random occurrence of all events from all fault segments, when
combined with an attenuation model, is used to develop a probability distribution
of peak acceleration at the site. The next section presents a theoretical
development of the earthquake occurrence model used in the analysis. The
following section describes how the contributions to the seismic hazard from
several distinct source regions are combined. Finally, the last section presents
the application of these models to the experiment site.
