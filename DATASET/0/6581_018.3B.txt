	(2)  Remoteness of the site from highly populated areas.

Evaluation

	The Yucca Mountain site is in southern Nye County, Nevada (see Figure
3-21).  Southern Nye County is bordered on the east by Clark and Lincoln 
counties and on the west by Esmeralda County.  Borders of these counties are
about 68 to 48 kilometers (42 to 30 miles) from the proposed location of the
surface facilities.  In 1980, neither Lincoln County nor Esmeralda County
contained any highly populated areas.  Since neither the incorporated city
(Gabbs) nor the census designated place (Tonopah) in Nye County had popu-
lations greater than or equal to 2,500 in 1980, neither are considered highly
populated areas for purposes of the evaluation of this guideline.  Gabbs is
about 248 kilometers (154 miles) to the northwest, and Tonopah is about
153 kilometers (95 miles) to the northwest.  The incorporated city of
Caliente in Lincoln County is not considered a highly populated area.  The
nearest highly populated area is the Las Vegas Valley in Clark County,
approximately 137 kilometers (85 miles) southeast of the proposed location of
the surface facilities.

	The unincorporated towns of Amargosa Valley and Beatty lie closest to
the Yucca Mountain site, at distances of 23 kilometers (14 miles, at the
nearest population concentration) and 31 kilometers (19 miles), respectively.
U.S. Bureau of the Census population estimates for these towns are not
available.  Beatty had an estimated population of 800 (Smith and Coogan,
1984).  Approximately 45 people were concentrated along U.S. Highway 95 in
the Amargosa Valley community formerly called Lathrop Wells; another 1,500
persons were located about 37 kilometers (23 miles) south of U.S. Highway 95
in the Amargosa Farm area; and approximately 280 persons lived at the
American Borate housing complex on Nevada State Route 373 about 45 kilometers
(28 miles) south of the surface facilities location (population data from
Smith and Coogan, 1984).  These are not considered highly populated areas.

Conclusion

	The Yucca Mountain site is remote from any highly populated area.  The
nearest highly populated area is about 137 kilometers (85 miles) to the
southeast of the proposed location of the surface facilities.  Therefore,
this favorable condition is present at Yucca Mountain.

Evaluation

	The surface facilities for a repository at Yucca Mountain would be
located in the center of an uninhabited area with a radius of at least
10 kilometers (6.2 miles).  Other than the work force currently engaged in
preliminary site investigations at Yucca Mountain as part of the Nevada
