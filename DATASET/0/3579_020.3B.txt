5.2.7 Product Certification

	The waste form producers are to develop and provide for
	retention, the records necessary to provide evidence of the
	acceptability of the canister and waste form which includes
	the canistered waste form. The WCP and/or WQR are to identify
	the types of records that will be developed during the waste
	form production process. The WQR is to identify the quality
	records required to be a permanent part of the overall
	canistered waste form product certification package. These
	documents are to be identified, collected, managed and deliv-
	ered in accordance with the requirements of subsection
	5.2.12.

5.2.8 Readiness Review

	Readiness reviews are to be planned, scheduled and conducted
	at significant transitional events in Waste Acceptance Process
	Activities leading up to and during high-level waste form pro-
	duction to assure that all necessary activities and actions
	have been satisfactorily completed before subsequent activity
	initiation is authorized. Readiness reviews shall be per-
	formed in accordance with DOE Guidelines for Application of
	Readiness Reviews to Department of Energy Activities, dated
	January, 1987.

5.2.9 Selective Application of Program Activities (Quality Levels)

	A systematic method by which quality assurance activities are
	selected and applied to Waste Acceptance Process Activities of
	high-level waste form production is to be established and
	implemented.

	The selective application method implemented shall be
	described in the WCP.
