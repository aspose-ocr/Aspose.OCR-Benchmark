(2) the internal logic of the submodels, and
(3) the various parameters throughout the model which control logic
    flow and output
  The model contains built-in error protection required to support
branching options and meaningful model output. Thus, barrier thicknesses are
reset at zero after being reduced to negative quantities, areal degradation
values are not permitted to exceed unity, and variables used in logarithmic
expressions or as divisors cannot be assigned values of zero. This logic,
which eliminates the need for error reporting in the Corrosion Model, can be
verified by the tests described below.

6.3.2 Definition of a Set of Necessary and Sufficient Tests

6.3.2.1 Stand-Alone Verification Tests

  A total of seven separate tests are required in order to verify
completely all sections and logic of the model, as described below. These
tests include the following five situations (termed cases):
  (A)	An ideal case, in which localized corrosion does not apply: Under
	these conditions, General Corrosion and Dry Oxidation will
	gradually thin the barriers after barrier resaturation time), and
	general corrosion is activated for all wetted barriers. The dry
	oxidation calculations should be stopped for each barrier as it
	becomes wetted.
  (B)	Cases in which localized corrosion occurs: The model contains
	three separate mechanisms of localized corrosion. Pitting, Crevice
	Corrosion, and Stress Corrosion Cracking sections of the model must
	each be invoked to test logic patterns, branching, and calculations
	of breached areas when applicable. In addition, the Stress
	Corrosion submodel contains three separate logic routings which
	must be tested. This testing may be accomplished in a single test
	involving multiple metal barriers (e.g., 5 or 6 metallic barriers
	of which three or more would be susceptible to localized
