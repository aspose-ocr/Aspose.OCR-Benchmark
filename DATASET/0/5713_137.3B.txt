128 MINING DISTRICTS
      camp has an elevation of 6,200 ft.
History. The district was discovered by J. L. Whipple while searching for a
      stray horse in the fall of 1920. The original location was purchased by
      Crampton & Crampton of Santa Monica, Cal., and promoted as the Ne-
      vada Silver Horn M. Co. by Weir Bros. & Co. of New York. A boom
      took place early in 1921 which subsided later in the year.
Geology. The country rocks of the Silverhorn District are limestonees and
      shales of Upper Paleozoic age cut by an acid dike. The ore deposit at
      the Silver Horn and Silver Dale Mines is a siliceous replacement of fault
      breccia at a shale-limestone junction and is believed by Anderson to have 
      a genetic relation with the neighboring acid dike. The ore consists mainly
      of quartz and the ore minerals are hornsilver and argentite. According 
      to Marriage, nickel is also present.
