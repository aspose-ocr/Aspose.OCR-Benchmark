  The units cored are intensely fractured with fractures commonly sealed or coated with
the following major minerals: kaolinite, nacrite, dickite, montmorillonite, quartz, calcite,
chlorite, pyrite, hematite, magnetite, and a ferruginous clay.
  The bedding planes in the thermally unaltered argillite interval are very obscure and
are visible only by wetting the core. The dips range from 10~ to 52~ (plate 1). Bedding
planes are more obvious in the thermally altered argillite zone and range from 18~ to 50~;
however, in the calcareous altered argillite interval the beds are essentially horizontal.
The bedding planes in the marbleized interval range from 40~ to 60~. The highly variable
dips in the various units are due to the highly complex structure.

				Core Index

  A core index (CI) was calculated for all the cores. A core index is a measure of
relative rock competency (J. R. Ege and M. J. Cunningham, unpub. data, 1975) and is calculated
by the following formula:


Broken core is defined as pieces less than 10 cm (0.4 in.) in length, core loss as core not
recovered from cored interval, and fractures as natural breaks, excluding breaks in broken
core interval. A CI greater than 50 indicates relatively incompetent rocks. In the Calico
Hills area relatively incompetent rocks are generally due to faulting, jointing, brittleness,
and intensity of alteration and brecciation.
  The CI for all the cores for the entire hole has been plotted on plate 1. Approximately
67 percent of the entire cored interval (30.5-771.2 m) is relatively incompetent rock (fig. 4).
Eighty-five percent of the argillite interval, 30.5-416.1 m (100-1,365 ft); 49 percent of the
thermally altered argillite interval, 416.1-676.9 m (1,365-2,221 ft); 14 percent of the cal-
careous altered argillite interval, 676.9-720.6 m (2,221-2,364 ft); and 30 percent of the
marble interval, 720.6-771.2 m (2,364-2,530.1 ft) represent relatively incompetent rock.

				Fracture Analysis

  In this analysis, fractures caused by drilling and (or) handling were not tabulated.
Fractures were classified as open or closed (sealed). In this report, open fractures are
defined as natural breaks with an aperture between the walls as they appear in the core box.
The walls can be either clean or coated with some mineral material. Closed fractures are
breaks whose walls are sealed or "glued" together by fracture filling material. Some of the
tabulated open fractures could possibly be closed fractures that have been reopened during
drilling and (or) handling.
  The fracture analysis consisted of sampling a population of fractures because of the
great number of fractures present in the core. A total of 2,430 fractures was tabulated
representing approximately 30 percent of the total fractures. The sampling technique
