Topopah Spring Member of the Paintbrush Tuff

Advantages

	~ Situated in the unsaturated zone some 230 m above the water
table, resulting in limited flux.
	~ Thick unit of devitrified welded tuff (approximately 350 m thick).
	~ High matrix thermal conductivity of about 1.6 W/m~C.
	~ Highest mechanical strength (100 MPa unconfined uniaxial
compressive strength).
	~ Rock relatively free of zeolites or clay minerals, with a
positive linear thermal expansion and a minimal release of water during
heating.
	~ Transport barrier to downward flux of nuclides, supplied by about
115 m of highly zeolitized rocks lying between this unit and the water
table.
	~ The shallowest of the four potential horizons, providing easiest
access, lowest thermal background, and least overburden pressure.

Disadvantages

	~ Highly jointed or fractured rock, making vertical hydraulic
permeability probably high and gas permeability high.
	~ Abundant lithopysae in some zones, resulting in reduced strength
and potentially increased lateral permeability (though the latter has
minimum consequence in the unsaturated zone).
	~ Limited knowledge of lateral variability of properties.
	~ Limited knowledge of hydrologic mechanisms and flow of water in
the unsaturated zone, especially in fractured tuff.

Tuffaceous Beds of Calico Hills

Advantages 

	~ Limited water flux, since throughout most of the repository block
these strata lie within the unsaturated zone from 30 to 150 m above the
water table in USW G-1 (Figure 7-10).
	~ Highly zeolitized, so highly sorptive and probably low in
permeability.
	~ Low frequency of fractures compared with the other horizons in
welded tuff.
	~ Easily mined by use of continuous mining machines.

Disadvantages

	~ Repository space with less lateral extent than for other
candidate horizons due to unit's thinning southward within the Yucca
Mountain block.
