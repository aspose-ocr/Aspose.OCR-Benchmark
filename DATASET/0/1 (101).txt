PARKS AND RECREATION COMMITTEE 

1996 

Everything went very well again this year. Amy Jo 
Devito was back as pool director and organized swimming 
lessons, the swim team and coordinated the lifeguard's 
schedule. Amy Jo did a wonderful job as pool director. 
Unfortunately, she will not be returning next year. We would 
like to thank her very much for a job well done, and we wish her 
well. Thanks to Josh Reardon and Vanessa Quinn for doing an 
excellent job for us. We hope to see you next year. 

This year we were able to build a volleyball court next to 
the pool house and put down new stone dust on the baseball 
field. We also sponsored a chess club, French language lessons, 
and tennis lessons. If all goes well, we will continue these 
activities in 1997 as they were very popular with residents. 

Our report would not be complete without thanking 
Charles Buttrick, Dave Bourgault, Mike Bergeron, and Mike Ypya 
for their invaluable help. Without their help with everything 
from chlorine storage and deliveries to answering questions 
about the history of the pool, we would not be able to run 
things as smoothly as we have. 

Our greatest thanks go out to you, the taxpayers who 
support the program year after year. Because of you, we can 
continue to offer positive, healthy, fun summer recreation to 
our families and children. Summer would be very bleak for 
many of the Town's children without these programs. Thank 
you! 

If you are interested in serving on the Parks & Recreation 
Committee, please leave your name at the Town Office.
