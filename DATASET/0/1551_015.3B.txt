The last two characterization items have not yet been conducted. Results for 
these items will be published as they become available.

    The detailed characterization plan and sampling matrix for the nine fuel 
rods that comprise ATM-101 are listed in Table 3.1.  Fuel rod N-9 was used to 
obtain several ceramography/metallography, burnup, and chemical samples.  The 
locations of these groups of samples were selected to cover the wide range in 
burnup levels present in any of the fuel rods.  The selected burnup analyses 
and the gamma scan results from each individual rod can be combined to assign 
the burnup and a resultant radionuclide inventory for any ATM specimen that 
will be provided from the lot of fuel rods.

    In addition to the characterizations planned for the ATM-101 material, 
special characterizations were conducted on some processed specimens distri-
buted to experimenters.  The results from these special characterizations are 
described in the appropriate subsection of Section 5.0 of this report that 
describes the distribution of ATM-101 specimens, e.g., results from the special 
examination of crushed ATM-101 material for the Basalt Waste Isolation Project 
(BWIP) are described in Section 5.1.

    Five to ten percent of the ATM-101 spent fuel will be retained by the MCC 
as archive material for future use.
