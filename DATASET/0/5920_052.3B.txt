Photomicrographs showing types of crystallization in lithophysal tuff.
Light area on left is vapor-phase-altered matrix around a lithophysa.
Darker area is devitrified shard matrix. Note presence of vapor-phase-
altered "lenses" within the devitrified matrix. Sample 1D-1. [A] Plane
polarized, transmitted light. [B] Crossed polarizers, transmitted light.
