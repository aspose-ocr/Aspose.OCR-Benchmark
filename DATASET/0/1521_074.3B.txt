that will be useful for later discussions in Chapter 9.0. Figure 5.3 is
a graph showing the relationship. The figure shows a representation of
results for the Grouse Canyon Member in G-Tunnel as presented by Lankopf
and Gnirk (1986). They established a range for the RMR of 43 to 80.
Data from the Heated Block Experiment were described by a range in the
modulus of deformation from 9.2 to 19.1 GPa and are also represented on
the figure. The two ranges identify a shaded area in Figure 5.3.

  The figure shows that the extremes of the RMR would not relate well
with the functional relationship. Using the recommended Ed of 16 GPa,
the equation in the figure would predict a RMR of 58, which is near the
mean of the range (61.5) defined by Lankopf and Gnirk (1986). The
conclusion in this comparison is that there is no reason to preclude
welded tuff from being included in such comparisons.

5.4 Numerical Model Comparisons

  A jointed rock continuum model, called the Joint Empirical Model
(JEM), has been formulated for use in modeling jointed rock response to
mechanical and thermomechanical loading (Blanford and Key, in prepara-
tion). This is an outgrowth of an earlier development called the Crack
and Void Strain (CAVS) model (Maxwell and Dial, 1981). Currently JEM is
embodied in SANCHO, a two-dimensional dynamic relaxation code developed
at SNL (Stone et al., 1985). The JEM model can account for the effects
of up to four arbitrarily oriented joint sets.

  The JEM model includes joint-shear and normal compliance equations
that are coupled. These equations are referenced to the analyses and
