  This is the second appraisal of the water supply of Pahrump Valley, made 15
years after the first cooperative study. In the first report the average recharge
was estimated to be 23,000 acre-feet per year, only 1,000 acre-feet more than
the estimate made in this report. All this recharge was considered to be available
for development. Because of the difficulty in salvaging the subsurface outflow
from the deep carbonate-rock reservoir, this report concludes that the perennial
yield may be only 12,000 acre-feet.
  In 1875, Bennetts and Manse Springs reportedly discharged a total of nearly
10,000 acre-feet of water from the valley-fill reservoir. After the construction of
several flowing wells in 1910, the spring discharge began to decline. In the mid-
1940's many irrigation wells were drilled, and large-capacity pumps were in-
stalled. During the 4-year period of this study (1959-62), the net pumping
draft averaged about 25,000 acre-feet per year, or about twice the estimated
yield. In 1962 Bennetts Spring was dry, and the discharge from Manse Spring
was only 1,400 acre-feet.
  During the period February 1959-February 1962, pumping caused an esti-
mated storage depletion of 45,000 acre-feet, or 15,000 acre-feet per year. If the
overdraft is maintained, depletion of stored water will continue and pumping
costs will increase. Water levels in the vicinity of the Pahrump, Manse, and
Fowler Ranches declined more than 10 feet in response to the pumping during
this period, and they can be expected to continue to decline at the projected
rate of more than 3 feet per year.
  The chemical quality of the pumped water has been satisfactory for irrigation
and domestic use. Recycling of water pumped for irrigation, however, could
result in deterioration of the water quality with time.

                    LOCATION AND EXTENT OF THE AREA

  The Pahrump Valley drainage basin discussed in this report in-
cludes about 1,050 square miles in Clark and Nye Counties, southern
Nevada, and Inyo and San Bernardino Counties, southeastern Cali-
fornia (fig. 1).  Approximately 200 square miles, or about 20 percent
