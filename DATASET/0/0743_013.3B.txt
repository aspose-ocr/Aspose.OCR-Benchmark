atmospheric pressure and room temperature. All of the samples exhibited 
an axial stress-axial strain behavior resulting in macroscopic brittle 
failure. The resultant unconfined compressive strengths, axial strains to 
failure, Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio ranged from 14.5 to 69.2 MPa, 
.0029 to .0052, 5.17 to 22.5 GPa and .09 to .38, respectively.
