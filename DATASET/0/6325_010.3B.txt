ABILITY TO DESIGN AND DEPLOY NUCLEAR MODULES WHICH COULD BE SHOP-
FABRICATED WITH IMPROVED QUALITY CONTROLS AND REDUCED CONSTRUCTION
COSTS PROVIDES A POTENTIALLY ATTRACTIVE OPTION.

	THE FRENCH, ALONG WITH THEIR EUROPEAN PARTNERS, HAVE MOVED
AGGRESSIVELY AND WITH A WELL DEFINED PURPOSE TO DEVELOP AND DEMON-
STRATE A COMMERCIAL-SCALE LIQUID METAL FAST BREEDER REACTOR.

	I HAVE VISITED THE FRENCH SUPER PHENIX PLANT AT CREYS
MELVILLE, AND I MUST SAY I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED.  THE SUPER
PHENIX BREEDER ACHIEVED INITIAL CRITICALITY IN SEPTEMBER AND IS
EXPECTED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE GRID ABOUT THE END OF THIS YEAR.

	WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR AN ACCEPTABLE DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY, THE FRENCH LONG AGO STOPPED SEARCHING AND DID IT, FULLY
RECOGNIZING THAT MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND BETTER ECONOMICS
WOULD FOLLOW.  THEY HAVE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS OVER ENERGY
SECURITY AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY.

	GERARD RENON, THE ADMINISTRATOR GENERAL OF THE CEA (COMMIS-
SION ENERGIE ATOMIQUE), THE FRENCH ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION, AND
MICHEL RAPIN, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR APPLIED RESEARCH AND
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, ARE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.  GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME, AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT.

			FOREIGN MARKETS

	JUST AS WE ARE LOOKING TO MEET INCREASING COMPETITION ABROAD
IN THE URANIUM ENRICHMENT BUSINESS, WE ARE ALSO LOOKING TO REMOVE
BARRIERS TO FOREIGN TRADE FOR THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY.

	SELLING AMERICAN NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY ABROAD IS GOOD BUSINESS.
IN THESE DAYS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS WE SHOULD VIGOROUSLY EXPLOIT
EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD.
THE UNITED STATES IS THE LEADER IN STATE-OF-THE-ART NUCLEAR POWER
PLANT TECHNOLOGY, AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE ABROAD SUCCESS-
FULLY.

	THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO GAIN CONGRESSIONAL
SUPPORT FOR A NUCLEAR COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT HOLDS MAJOR OPPOR-
TUNITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES, NOT JUST FOR ITS NUCLEAR INDUSTRY,
BUT FOR WORLD ENERGY STABILITY, U.S. ENERGY SECURITY, AN IMPROVED
INTERNATIONAL BALANCE OF TRADE AND A STRENGTHENED INTERNATIONAL
NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION ENVIRONMENT.
