GREENVILLE ESTATES VILLAGE DISTRICT REPORT 

1996 
1996 has been a very busy year for the Greenville Estates 
Village District. Construction of our sewer project began on the 
first of July. The main line on Route 31 as well as the two 
pumping stations were completed and on line by mid Fall. 
Approximately 1/2 of the homes in Greenville Estates are on the 
system. Due to the efforts of Park Construction Corp. and 
Underwood Engineering as well as the wonderful cooperation 
between Charlie Buttrick, the Selectmen and Greenville Estates 
this project has gone along with extreme efficiency. 

Upgrades to the pumps at the wastewater treatment 
plant are being done at this time (January 1997). Construction 
will begin again in full force in Greenville Estates in late Spring. 
Construction and cleanup will be finished by June 30, 1997. 

The burden of the bill to build this entire system is being 
borne entirely by the residents of Greenville Estates Village 
District. A 30 year, $500,000 note supplied to us by the Rural 
Economic Development Corp. will be paid back with semi- 
annual payments of approximately $110.00 per household. The 
rest of the projects funds, which totaled $3.3 million dollars 
came in the form of grants from the State Revolving Loan Fund 
Wastewater Project, Rural Economic Development Corp. and 
Community Development Block Grant. 

The completion of this project will bring closure to the 
continuing sewer disposal problems at Greenville Estates. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Christine Deane 
Greenville Estates 
Chairman, Board of Directors
