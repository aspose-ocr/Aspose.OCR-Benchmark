	The cost of the Ti-0.2% Pd alloy is about twice that of C.P.
titanium for comparable mechanical properties, while Ticode-12 offers a
significant strength advantage at a cost only moderately greater than
C.P. titanium.

	Considering the copper-base alloys, only the aluminum bronzes
have strength and ductility comparable to the 300 series stainless
steels and a similar cost. The aluminum bronzes generally are readily
weldable, but can be susceptible to cracking in the weld and parent
metal. The fairly low strength of most of the remaining copper-base
alloys would necessitate section thicknesses 50 - 100% greater than for
aluminum bronze, resulting in higher costs and increased fabrication
difficulties.

	In summary, on the basis of the properties considered in
Part I, three alloy groups can be identified as meriting further con-
sideration for use as containers for fuel immobilization:

1. AISI 300 series austenitic stainless steels.
2. High nickel-base alloys containing molybdenum.
3. C.P. titanium and very dilute titanium alloys.

	Within group 1, 316 L stainless steel is suggested as being
the optimum choice, whilst of the group 2 materials, Inconel 625 would
be favoured, since it is the cheapest and strongest and has no serious
disadvantages compared with other materials in this group. From group 3,
ASTM grades 2 and 12 titanium are recommended on the basis of cost,
strength and weldability, with the rider that the apparent absence of
susceptibility to embrittlement due to hydrogen effects and SCC must be
more completely established and understood.

	Of these specific alloys, 316 L stainless steel is the cheapest
material for a container design based on yield stress, but would result
in the greatest wall thickness and weight. This alloy is also by far
