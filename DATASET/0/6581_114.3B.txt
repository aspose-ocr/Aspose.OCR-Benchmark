	There are no permanent residents within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the
site and all land within this radius is currently federally controlled and
not open to settlement.  Access to the NAFR and NTS is restricted.  Nye
County, where the Yucca Mountain site is located, had a 1980 population
density of 0.5 person per square mile (Table 3-26).  The nearest population
center is located in the unincorporated Town of Amargosa Valley, whose
residents are spread out in numerous small settlements within its estimated
1,036 square kilometers (400 square miles) (Section 3.6.4.1.1).  Major
population concentrations are located in the community formerly called
Lathrop Wells, and now also called Amargosa Valley, approximately
23 kilometers (14 miles) to the south; the Amargosa Farm Area, approximately
37 kilometers (23 miles) to the south and the American Borate housing com-
plex, roughly 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the south.  Population of these
areas in 1984 was estimated to be 45, 1500, and 280 respectively (Smith and
Coogan, 1984).  An estimate of the total population of the unincorporated
Town of Amaragosa Valley is not available.

	Beatty, located about 31 kilometers (19 miles) to the northwest had an
1984 estimated population of 800 (Smith and Coogan, 1984).  Pahrump's 1984
population was estimated to 5,500 (Smith and Coogan, 1984).  It is located
slightly more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the southeast.  The nearest
highly populated area is in the Las Vegas Valley area about 137 kilometers
(85 miles) by air southeast of Yucca Mountain.  This is also the nearest
1 mile by 1 mile area having a population of at least 1,000 individuals
(Clark County Department of Comprehensive Planning, 1983).  All of the
distances cited above are straight-line distances, not road distances.

	Calculations for worst-case accident scenarios at Yucca Mountain have
been completed.  Preliminary results of a safety assessment study are avail-
able (Jackson et al., 1984).  This study assumes that a person could be
temporarily in an area 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the surface facilities.
Assuming this person to be the maximally exposed individual, preliminary cal-
culations for an extremely severe and unlikely accident at the repository
estimate that the worst-case maximum individual total-body equivalent dose
would be 0.055 rem, (0.068 rem 50-year dose commitment).  For comparsion, the
limit specified in 10 CFR Part 20 (1984) for normal operations is 0.5 rem per
year for an individual in an unrestricted area.  The worst-case accident-
related radiation exposure of the 19,908 people conservatively assumed, for
purposes of estimating worst-case dose, to live within 80 kilometers (50
miles) of the repository site at Yucca Mountain, is 110 man-rem, which is
much less than the annual background-radiation external dose commitment of
about 1,790 man-rem to the same number of people.

	Radionuclides released to the environment can potentially be transported
by both liquid and gaseous transport mechanisms.  At the Yucca Mountain site,
surface-water transport mechanisms are not considered likely, because of the
aridity of the climate and the absence of surface water.  The Yucca Mountain
site is located in one of the most arid regions of the United States, with an
average annual rainfall in the region of less than 150 millimeters (6 inches)
(Quiring, 1965; Bowen and Egami, 1983).  The arid conditions allow very
limited infiltration and recharge (Winograd and Thordarson, 1975; Montazer
and Wilson, 1984).  Ground-water transport is not a reasonable release mecha-
nism during the operation of the repository owing to the long ground-water
travel  time that is expected in the unsaturated zone (Section 6.3.1.1.5).
