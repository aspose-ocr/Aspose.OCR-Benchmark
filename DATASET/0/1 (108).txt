The Town Hall Renovation Committee 
1996 

The Town Hall Renovation Committee was formed 
through a warrant article following the March 1995 Town 
Meeting. The Committee was formed to examine the Greenville 
Town Hall to determine what modifications would be necessary 
to allow use of the upstairs meeting hall for public uses. 

Initially the group was concerned with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) and its implementation within the 
Town Hall. After many meetings and examination of the facility 
by Architects and the Towns Fire Prevention Officer it became 
apparent that the Town Hall is also lacking other Life Safety 
Items required by the State of New Hampshire Fire Codes. 

In order to meet ADA requirements an elevator or 
another lift device would be required to transport physically 
disabled personnel to the second floor. Without such a device 
any public meeting conducted in this hall could be ruled void if 
a disabled person was not able to attend due to the facility's 
inaccessibility. 

The Fire Codes, especially the 1988 edition of the 
National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) Code 101 "The Life 
Safety Code" requires a secondary means of egress from this 
second floor. This is required to allow a secondary means of 
escape from this area in the event the primary means of egress 
becomes blocked due to a fire in or near the main stairwell. 

The Fire Escape presently located on the Southern side 
of the Town Hall can no longer be treated as a viable means of 
egress. The escape has become loose from the building and is 
unstable when a single person is on it. The possibility of its use 
by many people during an emergency situation is inconceivable 
due to its present condition. 

In an architectural code survey it was also pointed out 
this type of structure now needs to have a sprinkler system or 
other protective finishes to improve the fire rating of the 
building.
