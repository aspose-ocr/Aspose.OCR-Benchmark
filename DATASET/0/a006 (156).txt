Crest, out of the waves of the seafroper, a tilting spear erect, gold; enﬁled with a dolphin,

silver, ﬁnned, gold, and charged with a shell.

[Cabnssed means cut 06 short so as not to show the neck; attired denotes the horns; canton
ermine, means the black spots upon the white ﬁeld in the left-hand corner. In the picture the

artist has not given the shell upon the dolphin.]

Motto.—” Quon VULT, VALDE VULT,”— What he wills, he wz'llr cordially and wit/tout rtz‘m‘.

Arms are hereditary, but the mottoes are not, and may be changed to suit the taste or fancy of
any family. There are other Arms of the Horton family, varying somewhat from the above. The

date of the grant of the arms I have not found—probably many centuries ago.
