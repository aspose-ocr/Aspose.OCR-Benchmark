TOWN TREASURER'S REPORT 
1996 

The Treasurer's job for 1996 proved to be fairly routine. 
As of the end of 1996, the Town has no more tax lien notes or 
tax anticipation notes outstanding. Proving balances to the 
general ledger in the Selectmen's Office is improving but still 
need attention. 

When examining the "Summary of All Accounts in Hands 
of Town Treasurer'" please consider the following. The Sewer 
Department Account has gone from $120,000 in EOY 1995 to 
$56,000 in EOY 1996. The Water Department Account has gone 
from $52,000 in EOY 1995 to $28,000 in EOY 1996. The Town 
continues to hold on to three subdivision escrow accounts (one- 
Russell, two-Pillsbury) which I hope will be terminated. I am 
now holding two Community Development Block Grants 
(CDBG), one of which (Water project) should be terminated, the 
other (Sewer project) is still active. 

Please feel free to stop by and take a tour of the 
Treasurer's duties. I am always looking for someone who will 
take a serious interest in public service. 

Sincerely, 
Richard S. Eaton 
Greenville Town Treasurer
