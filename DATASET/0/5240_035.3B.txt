  As a second approach, a vent count of Holocene centers ( 10,000 years
old) for a selected 2.6 ~ 104 km2 area (Figures 5 and 6) was completed.
Eighty-five vents were counted, yielding a rate of :
	8.5 ~ 10-3 events per year (Rate)
assuming each vent can be counted as one event (clearly invalid). Making the
same assumptions concerning the disruption zone as were made in the previous
section yields two cases:

	P = (8.5 ~ 10 -3/yr)(50.3 km2/2.6 ~ 104 km2) CASE ONE: Large Disrup-
								tion Zone
	  = 1.6 ~ 10-5/yr;

	P = (8.5 ~ 10-3yr)(10 km2/2.6 ~ 104) CASE TWO: Small Disruption Zone
	= 3.3 ~ 10-6/yr.

  As a final approach the dike surface area was calculated for 85 events in
10,000 years. Making the same areal assumptions for the dike area and disrup-
tion zone as were made in the previous section (2.1 km2) yields the follow-
ing rate:

	= (85 events)(2.1 km2) per 10,000 years
	= 1.8 ~ 10-2 km2 events per year. (Rate)

Using this approach, the probability is:

	P = (1.8 ~ 10-2)(10 km2/2.6 ~ 104 km2)
	  = 6.9 ~ 10-6/year.

DISCUSSION
  This paper represents a "first stab" at assessing the threat posed by vol-
canic activity to the long-term geologic storage of radioactive waste. The
approach taken is general and represents a necessarily oversimplified view of
volcanic hazards. The general cases that are considered in the worst case
