  The current seismic monitoring program was initiated October 8,
1975, prior to event Kasseri, the second of six large tests in an accel-
erated nuclear testing program in 1975 and early 1976. New seismic
stations were installed in the northern and central part of the NTS
(BMT, NPM, NRM, EPN, TMN, GLR, and SSP). These stations and the ten
stations which were already recording are shown in figure 1. The older
stations include LSM, CPX, and MCV on NTS, Angels Peak (APK), Las Vegas
(LVW), South Pahroc Range (PRN), and four which belong to Sandia Laboratories
including Darwin, Calif. (DAC), Nelson, Nev. (NEL), Tonopah, Nev. (TPH),
and Leeds, Utah (LEE). All the stations operated to the end of June
1976 except for a few temporary outages due to power or telephone line
difficulties.
  During this report period, there were five nuclear events in the
yield range 200-1,000 kt (kilotons), three events in the 200-500-kt
range, and two events with yields less than 20 kt in the Pahute Mesa and
Rainier Mesa regions of the Nevada Test Site. The location of these
events is show~ in figure 2.
  During the same period, there were five announced nuclear events on
Yucca Flat (east-central NTS). The yield ranges for these events are:
one in the 200-500-kt range, three in the 20-200-kt range, and one less
than 20 kt. These events are listed in the appendix, but are not shown
in figure 2 or succeeding maps, because they are not believed to be
associated with seismic activity.
