The tuff mineralogy used is given in Table D-4~ along with the
specific heats of the relevant phases. Notice that Figure D-2
is representative only and should not be used for tuff units
that have significantly different mineralogy than that listed
in Table D-4.

Suggested Range: 0.2 - 0.5 cal/gm~C at T = 25~C~
                 increasing slightly with temperature.
