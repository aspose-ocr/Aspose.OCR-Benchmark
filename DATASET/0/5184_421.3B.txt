Ms. Rebecca W. Hanmer    2
The protective action guides which EPA has under development will be of
interest to ERDA. If one compares EPA's guideline levels of 1 to 5 R
with the 0.170 R level which has been applied in the case of accidental
nuclear test ventings, the ERDA guide proves very conservative. The
probability of a venting that would cause offsite exposures in excess of
0.170 R is extremely remote. No such exposure has occurred since 1962;
meanwhile the containment methods have had dramatic improvements over
that period.

Your next comment deals with the likelihood of the testing accidents
that might cause radiation exposures. Unlike operations with nuclear
reactors, underground nuclear test operations are not of a nature such
that there can be quantitative evaluation of accident probabilities.
Because of this situation, ERDA has elected to use the 0.170 R FRC
exposure limit which has been found acceptable for protection of the
general population.

Regarding EPA's evaluation that the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
contained insufficient information, it is hoped that the above explanations
relative to the EPA questions and additional information included in the
Final Environmental Impact Statement will furnish a better understanding
of the matters involved and satisfy this deficiency. Copies of the
Final Environmental Impact Statement are enclosed for your information.

Sincerely,
W. H. Pennington, Director
Office of NEPA Coordination
