The five exploratory shaft sites were identified and an on-site
evaluation of their surface characteristics was conducted. The
criteria were then reviewed, subcriteria which could discriminate
between the sites were defined, and weighting factors were
developed. Nondiscriminating criteria were omitted. The relative
performance of each site for each subcriterion was determined and
a merit value computed. Table 2 shows the merit values for the
Scientific, Engineering, and Environmental criteria and the
cumulative Figure of Merit for each.

The Figures of Merit show why the Committee unanimously recom-
mended Site 4, located in Coyote Wash. Site 5 rated slightly
higher than Site 4 scientifically, but significantly lower in the
engineering and environmental considerations. Site 3 rated as
well as Site 4 environmentally and was a close second for
engineering, but was less valuable scientifically. Sites 1 and
2, located on the ridge top, were of lower value than the wash-
bottom sites for all considerations except engineering at Site 5.
