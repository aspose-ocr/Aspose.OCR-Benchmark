  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

  Literature reviews of rapidly-expanding subjects, such as the geological signifi-
cance and the industrial utilization of natural zeolites, can never be up to date;
however, with the generous help of many individuals in academie, industry, and govern-
ment, this author has tried to make this review as current as possible. The author's
gratitude is extended to L. L. Ames, G. H. Arscott, F. F. Aplan, D. C. England, W.
Kapranos, M. Koizumi, R. B. Laudon, R. T. Mandeville, H. Minato, E. Nemecz, L. B. Sand,
R. A. Sheppard, D. Tchernev, and D. E. W. Vaughan for numerous discussions and for pro-
viding unpublished information. Special thanks are due Mr. Kazuo Torii of the National
Industrial Research Institute, Tohoku, Sendai, Japan, for his many courtesies in pro-
viding data on the use of natural zeolites in Japan and for his translations of several
articles.
