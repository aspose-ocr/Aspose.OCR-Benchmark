The Zoning Board of Adjustment hears appeals and 
administers special provisions in the Greenville Zoning 
Ordinance dealing with variances, special exceptions, and 
administrative decisions. The Zoning Board of Adjustment 
hears and decides appeals if it is alleged there is an error in any 
order of determination made by the zoning administation. The 
Board also has the power to grant special exceptions as clearly 
specified in the Greenville Zoning Ordinance. The Board may 
also grant a variance from the zoning ordinance in specific cases 
when such a variance would not be contrary to the public 
interest, and if owing to special conditions, a literal 
enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary 
hardship, so the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and 
substantial justice done. 

The Board of Adjustment invites interested citizens to 
become members or alternate members of the Board. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Peter Simonson 

Secretary to Zoning Board of Administration
