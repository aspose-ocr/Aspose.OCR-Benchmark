			       EXPECTED CASE


Steps 2 and 3

	Rely on Calico Hills for release via groundwater pathway.

	Rely on EBS for gas/vapor Release

Step 3

	In Calico Hills Emphasize

	- Limitation of linear water velocity,
	- Physical retardation (matrix diffusion)
	- Chemical retardation.

Step 4

	Performance Measures

	A.  For Calico Hills

		1) Radionuclide transport times, T

		2) Radionuclide retardation factors, R (sorbing species)

		3) Radionuclide release over 10,000 years
