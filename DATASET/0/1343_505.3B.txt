certainty a dose below which teratologic effects in man are not induced by
exposure at sensitive stages in development. As discussed above, such
thresholds do, however, probably exist, and they may be higher for pro-
tracted or fractionated radiation than for acute single exposures.19,24,138

Radionuclides Administered During Pregnancy

The effects of various radioisotopes administered to pregnant mammals
have been less extensively studied than the effects of externally ad-
ministered radiation. Furthermore, one cannot generalize on the effects of
administered radionuclides, because, depending on the chemical form and
the type and energy of the emitted radiation, they may or may not cross
the placenta, they may have specific target organs, the distribution of
radiation may be nonrandom, the metabolism of radioactive elements or
compounds may vary greatly from person to person because of individual
biologic variations or because of the disease state of a given subject, and
the change in dose rate with time may be difficult to evaluate.35
Radioisotopes administered to the mother may also affect the newborn if
they are administered shortly before birth, because many are excreted in
the breast milk.10,178
  In any event, before one can estimate the potential hazard of ad-
ministering a radioactive nuclide or compound to a pregnant woman, one
must determine with some accuracy the total dose to the fetus or a par-
ticular fetal tissue, the dose rate and how it varies with time, and the
stages of gestation during which the radiation is received.
  Until recently,151 the radioactive isotopes of iodine were the radionu-
clides most commonly used in nuclear medicine. The two most important
ones are iodine-131 and iodine-125. Although inorganic iodide readily
crosses the placenta, iodine attached to proteins, hormones, and even
radioactive rose bengal is less likely to cross. However, a significant
amount of iodine usually is released from the labeled compounds and
becomes available to the fetus. There is probably no radioactively labeled
iodine compound that does not release some iodine to the circulation after
administration.
  The human fetal thyroid does not take up iodine before the twelfth
week;32,51 thereafter, however, its uptake increases, and it comes to a peak
in the sixth month.51 In the mouse, there is some evidence that the fetal
thyroid has a greater avidity for iodine than does the maternal thyroid.82
Because the human fetal thyroid accumulates considerably more
iodine-131 per gram than do other fetal tissues, an inadvertent
therapeutic dose to the mother of 5 mCi would deliver 6,500 rads to this
organ and thereby ablate it.50 If the dose of radioactive iodine is high
