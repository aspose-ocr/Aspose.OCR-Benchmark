STANDARDS AND SUGGESTED METHODS

Rock mechanics has not yet advanced to the stage where testing and observational
techniques can be rigorously standardized. However, the International Society for
Rock Mechanics (ISRM) and the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) have published "designations" and "suggested methods" for laboratory
and field testing and for description of rock materials. Several of these are listed
