Spent Fuel

The following assumptions have been made in this scenario:

~	A shipping cask containing a single PWR fuel assembly is delivered
	to the surface facility according to the procedures described in a
	reference truck transportation model (Shirley, 1983).

~	The vehicle is involved in a severe accident and diesel fuel fire at
	the loading dock of the waste-handling building.

~	The fire exposes the cask and the fuel assembly to a temperature
	of 800~C (1,500~F) (Dennis et al., 1978) for 30 min, the tempera-
	ture and time standards set in 10 CFR 71 (NRC, 1983) (DOE,
	1979). These standards for temperature and time are conserva-
	tive, and the probability that these standards will be exceeded is
	extremely low. The probability that a truck accident on the open
	road will exceed these standards ranges between 10-10 and 10-11
	accident/mi (McClure, 1981).

~	The cask and the cladding of the fuel assembly are breached,
	releasing fission gases and other volatilized radionuclides.

~	Workers at the loading dock are exposed to the radioactive plume
	before the concentration of radionuclides has been reduced by
	dilution and dispersion.

~	Other workers onsite are also exposed to radiation during site
	evacuation, which is estimated conservatively in this preliminary
	assessment to require 1 hr.

Mitigation

  Low speed limits (5 to 10 mph) for tractor trucks in waste-handling
areas should be required. Thus, if an accident should occur, the conse-
quences would be lessened because the probability of a cask breach at low
