Greenville Conservation Commission 
1996 Annual Report 

The Conservation Commission was created by The Town 
of Greenville in 1990 to protect the natural and watershed 
resources that lie within and around our town. 

This past year has been very busy largely because the 
State of New Hampshire is reorganizing its Department of 
Environmental Services; local Conservation Commissions have 
been given more input as well as responsibilities in the 
Wetlands permitting process. 

The year started out with a series of meetings with 
representatives of the Greenville Estates Village District sewer 
line project, who requested that we "expedite" their application 
to the state Wetlands Board for a minimum impact wetlands 
permit. We learned much about the wetlands permitting 
process, through this and several other on-going cases involving 
wetlands that we continue to monitor. 

Some of us attended Wetlands Board classes this 
summer; this branch of the Department of Environmental 
Services was poorly funded by the state and relied greatly on 
local Conservation Commissions to monitor and help enforce 
water quality laws. Officials from each of the state's 
Environmental Services divisions (Water, Air, and Solid Waste) 
have called us and requested help in investigating cases of 
violations reported to them. We have assisted them and kept 
watch over other projects in town with potential to pose danger 
to the human environment. 

We presented a summer series of slide lectures on wild 
edible and useful plants, and have continued to teach classes on 
birds and botany to the local school children. We have walked 
the boundaries of our Town Forest, and Pat Nelson, our newest 
member, is preparing a natural resource inventory on that land. 

We continue to co-sponsor, with the local Scouts, the 
Town Clean -up in the spring. 

While we have quietly existed as a town commission 
without a budget for 7 years, we can no longer easily do so.
