jointed than the nonwelded material, it is more difficult to assess
whether damage to finished rock surfaces is the result of the mining
technique. The mechanical miner was successfully used to cut the welded
tuff and level the floors. Relatively rapid wear of the picks attached
to the rotating drum was noted.
   Spans of G-Tunnel openings in the welded material range from 3.4 to
5 m. The cross section of the experiment drift identified is 5 m wide by
5 m high, approximately the dimensions being considered for the drifts in
the repository. During the excavation of the extensometer drift, miners
were unavailable for one to two months after seven blasting rounds had
been shot, which left an unsupported roof along 14 m of drift. During
this time, no deterioration of roof material was evident. Following this
hiatus, roof bolts and wire mesh were successfully installed in the roof.
Rockmass Classification of Yucca Mountain Tuffs
   Rockmass classification systems have been applied in an assessment of
excavation characteristics and support requirements for mined openings in
Yucca Mountain (Johnstone, Peters, and Gnirk, 1984). These
classification systems use rock strength data, rock quality designations
as determined from core observations, joint characteristics (spacing and
condition), and groundwater conditions. Two rockmass classification
systems were used: the NGI (Norwegian Geotechnical Institute)
Classification System proposed by Barton et al. (1974a) and the CSIR
(South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
Geomechanics) Classification System proposed by Bieniawski (1976). Each
system emphasizes joint characterization. Barton's system also considers
a stress factor. These calculation systems are used mainly for single
