  Between the lava and the sediments are minor erosional gaps, but
these are probably current erosional unconformities, and the series is
approximately all of one age. Bedding planes from 2 inches to 20
feet apart are well developed at some places.
  Locally the tuffaceous sandstone lies unconformably upon folded
Pogonip limestone. It is closely similar to that of the Mount Jack-
son hills and, like it, is overlain by siliceous lavas. This formation is,
without much doubt, the Siebert lake beds.
  A number of small areas of conglomerate occur on the eastern slope
of the Amargosa Range, east of boundary post No. 94, southeast of
Daylight Spring and north of Willow Spring. The rocks, varying
from loosely to rather strongly consolidated material, consist of con-
glomerates and arkoses with a little shale. They range in color from
green to red, yellow, or brown. Bedding planes, which are from 1
inch to 2 feet apart, are well developed. The pebbles in the conglom-
erate, which are very well rounded and many of them highly polished,
reach a maximum diameter of 4 inches. They are derived principally
from the Paleozoic rocks near by, with here and there a pebble of fine-
to medium-grained granite, and in the area east of boundary post No.
94 some of earlier rhyolite. These rocks appear to be the shore de-
posits of a lake in which waves swept with considerable force. Mate-
rial was transported from considerable distances, since granite does
not now outcrop in the vicinity. Since the conglomerate contains
pebbles of rhyolite and none of basalt, the deposits are younger than
the rhyolite (early Miocene) and older than the basalt (Pliocene-
Pleistocene), and in consequence of middle or late Tertiary age, pre-
sumably Miocene. They are approximately contemporaneous with
the lake in which the Siebert lake beds were deposited, and it is be-
lieved that they are shore deposits of that lake. The conglomeratic
lake beds of the Funeral Mountains, south of the area mapped, are
to be correlated with these conglomerates.
  Older alluvium.-~From a poimt 8 miles north of Surveyors Well to
a point 3 miles north of Mesquite Spring the western flank of the
Amargosa Range is formed of older alluvium, and the same forma-
tion covers a considerable area west of boundary post No. 85. This
deposit consists of clays and bowlder beds similar to those of Death
