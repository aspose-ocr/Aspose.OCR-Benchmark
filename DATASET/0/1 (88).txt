JOINT LOSS PREVENTION COMMITTEE 
(SAFETY COMMITTEE) 

The Joint Loss Prevention Committee held 6 meetings 
during the past year. Kathleen Valliere was elected Chairman, 
and Mary Pelletier as Secretary. 

Work on the fire escape on the east side of the Town Hall 
has not been completed; we attended a joint meeting with the 
Town Hall Committee, and are awaiting direction from their 
report. 

At each meeting we tested the Panic Alarms, and 
reviewed all areas for possible hazards. 

Charles Buttrick attended a Compensation Funds of New 
Hampshire seminar in April, and reported at the June meeting. 
Recommendations were made that all insurance claims be 
turned into the Town Office promptly, and that all training 
sessions attended by Town Employees should be documented 
and placed in personnel folders. 

A Release and Waiver of Liability and Indemnity 
agreement was drawn up for participants in Town sponsored 
programs. 

Fire Chief David Bourgault presented a Fire Extinguisher 
Training Session for all Town Employees in June. This was very 
well received, and we recommend that a similar session be 
presented to the general public. 

We feel strongly that access from the Selectmen's Office 
to the Court Room needs proper and adequate illumination. 

We plan to continue to anticipate and address possible 
safety problems in the various Town-owned buildings and 
facilities. 

Respectfully submitted, 
Mary Pelletier 
Secretary
