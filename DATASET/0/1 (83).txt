The Fire Department celebrated its 100th anniversary in 

1996. In honor, we held several events which included an open 

house in March. The open house displayed historical pictures 

and artifacts of the past 100 years. Commemorative books are 

still available at the Library. In July we helped sponsor the 3rd 

of July activities and we ended our anniversary with a Fireman's 

Ball in October. 

We were able to do some much needed work to the 
station this past year. This included the building of a new 
communications work area, the painting of the main bays, and 
bathroom areas, painting in the kitchen and parts of the 
upstairs hall and the replacement of the concrete floor on the 
middle bays. The front of the station was repaved in the fall. 

1996 also brought some changes to department operations. 
The department now has eight EMTs. They have been utilized 
since last October when the rescue squad began responding to 
medical calls. This change cut down on response time to the 
patients and helps provide a better service to the townspeople. 

In closing, the past year was a positive one, and we look 
forward to continued growth in the next year to come. 
Respectfully, 
David P. Bourgault 
Fire Chief
