    In the single vertical fracture models, fluid enters the fracture from the 
fracture faces and no fluid enters from the ends.   However, for the case when 
a pumping well intersects a natural fracture or an artificial fracture which is 
part of an interconnected network of fractures, which is significantly more 
permeable than the matrix, the fluid enters the fracture primarily from inter-
sections with other fractures, i.e., the ends, rather than from the faces.  The
fluid then flows linearly into the well (Figure 3.1).   Moreover, the formation 
linear flow period (Gringarten and Ramey, 1974; Gringarten et al., 1975; 
Cinco-Ley et al., 1976) provides evidence that the fluid entering the fracture 
flows linearly.   Therefore, it seems plausible to construct a model which 
assumes a linear flow region around the well that intersects vertical fractures.

   The proposed model is a composite system with two concentric regions.
The inner region contains a finite number of fractures and flow is assumed to 
be linear.   The outer region is the classical porous medium where only radial 
flow takes place.   Similar composite models have been examined previously 
(Larkin, 1963; Bixel and van Poollen, 1967; Ramey, 1970) but none has con-
sidered a linear-radial flow combination.  The solution is presented in a series
of type curves, so that the flow properties of the fracture system can be 
determined by curve matching.   A field example is presented to demonstrate 
the type curve matching technique that can be used to characterize the frac-
ture as well as the average system parameters.
