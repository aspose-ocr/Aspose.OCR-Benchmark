Diversion Box

An enclosure where inlet and outlet pipes are connected by jumpers, which
permits a selection of pathways for liquid process streams or effluents.

Enriched Uranium

Uranium containing more than the natural concentration of the 235U iso-
tope. Natural uranium typically contains 0.7% 235U. Commercial power reactor
fuel contains uranium enriched to about 2 to 3%.

Fuel Assembly

A grouping of fuel pins bundled together to form a fuel assembly unit in a
reactor core. This group is not taken apart during the loading and unloading of
a reactor core.

Half Life

The time in which half the atoms originally present in a given quantity of
a radioactive element disintegrate to another element.

High Level Liquid Waste

The raffinate from the first cycle solvent extraction step of a spent fuel
reprocessing plant. Equivalent concentrated wastes from subsequent extraction
cycles and solvent cleanup sludges are also considered as high level liquid
waste.

Ion Exchange

A reversible chemical reaction between a solid and a fluid mixture by means
of which ions may be interchanged. The solid material is usually a plastic or a
resin. This is used to separate chemicals such as fission products or rare
earths from solution.

Production Reactor

A nuclear reactor designed primarily for large scale production of pluto-
nium, tritium or other radionuclides by neutron irradiation.
