waste-emplacement rooms that shows the location, spacing, and size of

emplacement holes.

     For mining, the narrative will identify and describe the proposed mining

techniques, including the major equipment needed for each technique, the

expected rate of advance, maintenance requirements, and the flexibility of the

mining method.  Also discussed will be muck handling from the face of the rock

to the muck-handling facility, with a listing of equipment requirements.

Schematic drawings of the mining and muck-handling operations will be included.

     Other construction activities to be addressed in this section will

include the installation of utilities and ventilation structures and

equipment.  The utilities outside the shaft pillar will be addressed only to

the extent of identifying the utilities, both temporary and permanent, that

will be provided in various areas of the facility.

     For the ventilation and cooling design, the narrative will include (1)

the functions; (2) the design philosophy, explaining how the mine-development

air system is separated from the emplacement ventilation system; (3) the

differential pressure that will exist between the two systems at various

strategic locations underground; (4) air temperatures at all underground

locations; (5) both temporary and permanent stopping, as well as their use;

and (6) methods of changing a room from the mining ventilation system to the

emplacement ventilation system.
