encapsulated in a medically-sealed, stainless-steel
container for the purposes of the test.
  Now, people have had terrible concerns
as to whether or not the cask is capable of protecting
the radioactive material that's contained in that spent
fuel element during its transport. Questions arise, if
there is an accident, will this cask prevent the radioactive
materials from being distributed into the countryside and
representing a significant cleanup problem?
  Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque, New
Mexico has conducted some tests for the Department looking
at the stability of these casks in terms of protecting the
cargo during such accidents. We have a three-minute film
that will show the tests that were conducted for the
Department, and we'd like to show those right now at this 
time.

  (The following portion of the
  transcript was recorded via film.)

  When transporting high-level radioactive
materials such as spent fuel from nuclear power plants,
the watchword is safety, protecting the people working
with the materials, but, above all, in the event of a
violent accident, protecting the public.
