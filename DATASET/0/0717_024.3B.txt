  For emplacement scheme 3 the location of the maximum
temperatures are shown in Figure 26. In this case the
maximum temperatures do exceed 100~C. Moreover, three-
dimensional thermal analysis [11] has shown that the two-
dimensional calculations presented here underestimate the
volume enclosed by the 100~C isotherm. We note that the
temperatures calculated using SAGUARO are higher than those
calculated in two-dimensions using COYOTE in reference [11].
This is due to the fact that the heat of vaporization of
water cannot be accounted for in SAGUARO.
  Because of the proximity of the canister to the drift
in emplacement scheme 2, the greatest change in the tempera-
ture profiles was caused by assuming that the temperature at
the drift was 25~C (to simulate ventilation), as shown in
Table 3. The fluid flow caused by the saturation boundary
condition at the drift influenced the temperature profiles
less. In emplacement scheme 3, however, water passing the
canisters had a pronounced cooling effect, as shown in
Table 4.

  b. HEAT FLUX CALCULATIONS

     Heat fluxes at the drift wall were calculated using
SAGUARO for both emplacement schemes 2 and 3. It is difficult
to directly compare results for the two emplacement schemes;
however, we have provided the results in two forms. We have
computed the amount of heat removed from the drift per canister
and per unit length of drift and plotted the values as functions
