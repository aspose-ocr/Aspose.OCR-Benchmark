was at once ﬁnal and fatal. He again reached
the Gulf, somewhere in the neighborhood of St.
Marks, with his command woefully wasted and
diminished by toil, battle and disease; and, as

in the early days of October, its destinatioh
being Mexico—a destination, however, which
was but another delusion that the winds and
the waves were to dispel.

Narvaez found a grave in the maw of the sea,
as did most of the remnant of his followers.
Famine swept off others, leaving only four to
reach Mexico after a land journey requiring
years, marked by perils and sufferings incident
to such a journey through avast forest bounded
only by the sea, intersected by great rivers, in-
habited by savages, and infested by wild beasts.
