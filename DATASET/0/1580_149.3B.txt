Equation 3.5.7 is actually made up of three subfunctions for the shear
modulus, yield stress, and a post-yield flow rule. All functions can be
expressed in one of several standard forms including constant values,
polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric forms, as defined by the
user.

For a thermal-mechanical fully coupled analysis, which is a capability
of STEALTH, Equation 3.5.4 is expanded to:


where


Numerical Approximations - Lagrange explicit finite-difference equations
are used to solve separate meshes, a displacement mesh and a stress
mesh. The displacement mesh is made up of grid points that define geo-
metric quantities such as shapes, interfaces, and boundaries. Conserva-
tion of momentum is used in the displacement mesh to solve for accelera-
tion, velocity, and position at specific points in the mesh. The stress
is evaluated in zones. Scalars and tensors such as stress, internal
energy, and pressure are evaluated as averages over zone volumes and
surface areas using conservation of energy along with constitutive equations.

The most significant numerical approximation associated with an explicit
finite-difference scheme is the discretization of time and space.

Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects - None.

Assumptions and Simplifications - The principal simplification is the
reduction of the differential equations for momentum, mass, and energy
