REPORT OF TOWN FOREST FIRE WARDEN AND STATE 
FOREST RANGER 

To aid your Forest Fire Warden, Fire Department and 
State Forest Ranger, contact your local Warden or Fire 
Department to find out if a permit is required before any open 
burning. Violations of RSA 227-L:17, the fire permit law and the 
other burning laws of the State of New Hampshire are 
misdemeanors punishable by fines of up to $2,000 and/or a year 
in jail. Violators are also liable for all fire suppression costs. 

There are ten Forest Rangers who work for the N.H. 
Division of Forests and Lands, Forest Protection Bureau. State 
Forest Rangers are available to assist communities with forest 
fire suppression, prevention and training programs as well as 
the enforcement of forest fire and timber harvest laws. If you 
have any questions regarding forest fire or timber harvest laws 
please call our office at 271-2217. 

The State of New Hampshire operates 15 fire towers, 2 
mobile patrols and 3 contract aircraft patrols. This early 
detection and reports from citizens aid in the quick response 
from local fire departments.
