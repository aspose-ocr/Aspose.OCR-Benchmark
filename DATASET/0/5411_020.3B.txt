showing that clinoptilolite and phillipsite had altered to analcime, and Surdam and
Eugster (1976) documented the reaction of erionite to analcime. Thus, analcime in
tuffs of saline, alkaline-lake deposits formed from precursor zeolites and not
directly from silicic glass.
  Sheppard and Gude (1969), studying the diagenesis of tuffs in the Barstow For-
mation, and Surdam and Eugster (1976), studying the mineral reactions in tuffaceous
rocks of the Lake Magadi region, suggested a correlation between the composition of
the zeolite precursor and the Si/Al ratio of analcime. They observed that analcime
associated with and derived from clinoptilolite and erionite has a relatively high
number of silicon atoms per unit cell (34.5-35.3), whereas analcime associated with
and derived from phillipsite (a silica-deficient zeolite) has a low number of silicon
atoms per unit cell (33.1-34.4). Boles (1971) studied the experimental reaction of
clinoptilolite and heulandite to analcime and showed that the Si/Al ratio of the
analcime product is chiefly a function of the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite reactant.
From both field observations and laboratory experiments, there is a strong support
for the reaction of zeolite to analcime; the analcime inherits its Si/Al ratio from
the zeolite precursor.
