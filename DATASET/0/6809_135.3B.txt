conditions. Applicable requirements developed for licensed nuclear
facilities, such as Regulatory Guide 1.23, shall be used in designing the
system for collecting meteorological data. (This system is currently designed
and operating at Yucca Mountain.)

8.2.23.3 Environmental Monitoring

Environmental monitoring shall adhere to the requirements of DOE Order
5480.4, "Environmental Protection, Safety and Health Protection Standards."
Environmental monitoring equipment shall be provided to acquire baseline data
for site characterization and performance confirmation. TLDs shall be
provided as radiation monitors for monitoring radiation levels at various
locations surrounding the site.

Wells provided for monitoring underground water quality for radioactive
contamination shall be provided as required.

8.2.23.4 Seismic Monitoring

A seismic monitoring system shall be provided to detect seismic events
and record associated ground motions. The regional and local detection
provisions will be satisfied by an array of continuously recording, high-gain
instruments distributed regionally at the ground surface and locally at both
the ground surface and depths below the anticipated repository levels. These
instruments will provide microseismic coverage, both regionally and locally.
Seismic monitoring shall also be provided for structures, systems, and
components important to safety to determine structural response of these
facilities to ground motion.

Adequate instrumentation shall be provided to monitor ground motions due
to earthquakes and UNEs at surface and at depth.

8.2.24 Concrete Batch Plant
 
A concrete batch plant shall be provided near the men and materials shaft
to supply concrete for underground development. Adequate space shall be
provided for the storage of cement and aggregates.
