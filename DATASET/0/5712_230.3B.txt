218   Mineral Resources of Nye County


    Properties.  Old workings, possibly abandoned, include a 150-
foot inclined shaft and an old adit about 100-feet in length. The
shaft was sunk on the dip of a 4-foot quartz vein in rhyolite. It
appears that the work may have been started on near-surface
enrichment of oxidized silver minerals.  These enriched surface
ores were usually an incentive for deeper work.  A cabin on the
ground is in rehabilitable condition and indicates that the last
work here may have been done in the thirties.
  The Pittsburg group, owned by E. J. Reed and Ed Slavin of
Tonopah, is said to lie about 4 miles east of the Tolicha road and
the old workings of the Wilsons district. A mineralized zone lies
in and adjacent to several parallel quartz veins striking north-
east.  The values are in silver and gold.
  The workings include a 300-foot inclined shaft with 40 feet of
laterals on the 100-foot level, 175 feet on the 200, and 350 feet on
the 300- or bottom level.  Samples noted, indicate low silver values 
and some gold in the workings off the shaft.  A 425-foot adit is
said to show little indication of ore.
