normally be discussed in the selectmen's narrative except for 
the fact that they underscore that the water system will need 
major overhaul in the near future. One of the warrant articles 
addresses the fact that there is no major reserve fund for water 
system renovation. 

We are please to welcome Tom Richardson to the Police 
Department. Officer Richardson was hired with a federally 
funded COPS FAST grant, which provides a three year salary 
subsidy to the Town. 

The Selectmen express their disappointment that 
neither the Blanch Farm nor the Acker properties are back on 
the tax roll this year. 

The Selectmen take this opportunity to thank the many 
Greenville residents who have given generously of their own 
time to serve without compensation on the many boards and 
committees. The Town relies heavily on the volunteer 
membership of concerned citizens for its many committees and 
the Selectmen encourage residents to come forward and make 
themselves available for committee work. 

Last but not least, the Board of Selectmen thanks all 
Greenville voters who cast their ballots in Town elections, 
attend the Annual Town Meeting to vote on the Greenville 
budget and warrant articles and who attend the Annual School 
District Meeting in order to vote on a responsible budget and 
other matters to come before the voters.
