  It can be seen in figure 39 that the regression equation closely ap-
proximates the finite difference standard molal heat capacities of dolo-
mite up to ~ 1350~K. Calculation of the standard molal entropy of dis-
order at 1 bar for s = 1 to s = 0 from eq (18) and the heat capacity co-
efficients in table 8 for dolomite and its completely ordered counterpart
yields 2.79 cal mole-1 (~K)-1, which is only 0.04 cal mole-1 (~K)-1
greater than that generated by the Bragg-Williams equation for ~S~~~
which can be written as


It can be deduced from table 8 that similar calculations lead to ~H~~
= 2927 and ~G~d = 2107 cal mole-1 for s = 1 to s = 0. Consequently,
metastable disorder in dolomite may affect significantly its thermo-
dynamic behavior, both in the laboratory and in geochemical processes.

temperature at 1 bar. The curves were generated from eq (19) and heat capacity
coefficients given in table 8.
