Flash Flooding

Suggested Favorability Rationale (Neal, 1984):

5 - Low potential for surface flooding.
    Sites virtually out of 500-year and 
    regional maximum flood areas
3 - Intermediate potential
1 - Potential exists for surface flooding.
    Sites occupy predicted 500-year and
    regional maximum flood areas or areas
    predicted by Hoover as flood-susceptible

3.2.2   Operating Safety--(0.298)

	This major topic is not specifically included in the DOE Siting 
Guidelines but was added to the NNWSI factors when it was realized 
that radiological safety was involved.  That is, each subcategory 
has potential for accident scenarios that could lead to radiological 
releases.  Further, it was evident that the candidate sites could be 
distinguished from one another in these subcategories.  Two factors 
were identified: inclination of ramps for waste delivery, and 
tectonic factors that cannot be reasonably circumvented by 
engineering (added cost), e.g., fault displacement.

	Two different target ramp locations were considered because the
underground design is incomplete at this time.  One is to the
centroid of a potential "central block" repository, and the other is
to the Exploratory Shaft (ES) vicinity.  The possibility of
