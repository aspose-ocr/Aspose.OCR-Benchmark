for site selection that by design involves public hearings,
numerous review stages, environmental assessments, and
consultations with local and state officials.
  In what stretch of the imagination does the
creation of a permanent repository for in excess of 8,000
tons of high-level radioactive waste not become classed as
a major federal action? Irrespective of that "quirk of law"
major impacts upon this county and within the area will
occur.
  A construction work force for this project,
estimating 3,000 to 5,000 temporary workers, with a permanent
work force between 800-1,200 is likely to substantially
impact the county. As you are well aware, northern Nye
County has recently been seriously impacted by Anaconda's
Nevada-Moly Project, with a construction force of 750
temporary workers, and 350 permanent work force.
  Your project, some three times the size of
