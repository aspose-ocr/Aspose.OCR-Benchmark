STATEMENT OF WORK

Task One: Editing and verifying existing GEOTHERM1 data file for Nevada
          springs and wells.

  The existing GEOTHERM file contained 544 separate entries for the State
of Nevada. Of those, 340 were in the regular file and an additional 204 were
in the USGS WATSTOR file. Because of the poor quality of the WATSTOR data,
the inability on our part to trace the original references, and on the recom-
mendation of J. Swanson, the WATSTOR file was eliminated from further consider-
ation. The remaining 340 entries were edited and verified on the basis of a
format suggested by GEOTHERM file supervisor Swanson. The editorial work con-
sisted of corrections, additions, and deletions for the following items: source
name; source location, including State, County, digitized latitude and longi-
tude, Township, Range, and section; temperature (in degrees centigrade); flow
rate; aqueous geochemistry; and miscellaneous information. All corrections,
additions, and recommended deletions were forwarded to the GEOTHERM file
supervisor in November, 1978.
  Problems involving changes in location accounted for almost 70 percent of
the total of 330 corrections. The remaining 30 percent involved changes in
the literature reference, temperature, spelling, source name, maps, and
scientific units.

Task Two: Supplementing the USGS data file GEOTHERM with NBMG data.

  The NBMG compiles and collects data on geothermal springs and wells and
has approximately 1100 individual data sheets on file. These sheets contain
1) GEOTHERM is the name of a U. S. Geological Survey computer file which
   contains data on physical, chemical, and geological aspects of geo-
   thermal springs and wells throughout the United States.
   Mr. J. Swanson, USGS, Menlo Park, CA, is the GEOTHERM file supervisor.
