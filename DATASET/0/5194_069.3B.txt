APPENDIX A
Description of the Theoretical Basis
for Transport Calculations


  A repository contains M(t) metric tons of heavy metal radioactive waste in
a planar horizon distributed over an area expressed in square meters. The
repository is assumed to be a height, H, in meters above the water table. The
volume of groundwater moving vertically downward through a unit area at the
repository horizon per unit time is called the flux and is assumed to be a
parameter, F, given in meters per year. Flow in the unsaturated zone is
assumed to obey Darcy's law. The boundary of the accessible environment is
assumed to occur in the saturated zone a distance 2 to 10 km downgradient from
eastern edge of repository. Water flow time through the saturated zone is
treated as a constant, TS.

A.1 Water Flow

  Let j, a subscript, identify two components of the medium (porous matrix
and fractures) with j=1 denoting the matrix and j=2 denoting the fractures.
Darcy's law for flow in both the matrix and fractures is expressed by


where hj is hydraulic head, ~~~~~~ is the hydraulic gradient, Kj is the
hydraulic conductivity, and Fj is called Darcy velocity or Darcy
