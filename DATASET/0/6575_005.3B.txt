					ABSTRACT


	In February 1983, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) identified the
Yucca Mountain site in Nevada as one of nine potentially acceptable sites for
a mined geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste.  The site is in the Great Basin, which is one of five distinct
geohydrologic settings considered for the first repository.  To determine
their suitability, the Yucca Mountain site and the eight other potentially
acceptable sites have been evaluated in accordance with the DOE's General
Guidelines for the Recommendation of Sites for the Nuclear Waste
Repositories.  These evaluations were reported in draft environmental
assessments (EAs), which were issued for public review and comment.  After
considering the comments received on the draft EAs, the DOE prepared the final
EAs.

	On the basis of the evaluations reported in this EA, the DOE has found
that the Yucca Mountain site is not disqualified under the guidelines.  The
DOE has also found that it is suitable for site characterization because the
evidence does not support a conclusion that the site will not be able to meet
each of the qualifying conditions specified in the guidelines.  On the basis
of these findings, the DOE is nominating the Yucca Mountain site as one of
five sites suitable for characterization.
