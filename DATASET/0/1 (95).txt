MONADNOCK FAMILY SERVICES 
1996 

As you know, Monadnock Family Services is active in 
your community providing quality mental health services to all 
residents who need them regardless of their ability to pay. As 
part of this mission, we feel it is important to let you know the 
extent of our work. We are pleased to give you the enclosed 
census report which outlines the services provided to Greenville 
residents during the 1995/1996 fiscal year. 

MFS is requesting financial support to help underwrite 
services we provide to uninsured and underinsured individuals 
in Greenville. We are asking for an amount equal to $1 per 
capita based on figures from 1993 population estimates from 
the NH Office of State Planning. For Greenville, this amounts to 
$2,200.00 We work continually to keep our costs down, and to 
identify, whenever possible, alternate sources of funding for 
this population. As a result, our requests to towns have 
remained unchanged since 1990. 

The support you have provided to MFS in the past is 
deeply appreciated, and we hope that our partnership in caring 
for the citizens of Greenville will continue with the 
incorporation of this request in your town's budget. 

Again, we appreciate the assistance you have offered in 
the past. In light of the current pressures and challenges we all 
face as town administrators, helping professionals and private 
citizens, it is more important than ever that we work together 
for the health and well-being of our communities. 

Thanks for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 

Lee Bruder
