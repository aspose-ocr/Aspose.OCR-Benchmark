  For a surface characterized by a spatially variable resistance to slip, there may be
many local extrema in |~~(~) - ~~(~)| = ~(~) over any interval of interest. Under these
circumstances, a more appropriate measure of the distance between the two functions,
or the size of ~, is the mean square norm, ||~||, defined as


Now, the size of the mean square norm, when it can be calculated, will be a predictor of
the rate of onset of sliding, or the sharpness of the torque-twist (stress-displacement)
curve. In other words, the magnitude of ~(~) is a measure of the propensity of the
interface for unrestrained sliding.

Normal stress change during constant velocity slip

  It is apparent from the structure of (1.6) that the search for normal stress history
effects parallels that described in the previous section on velocity history effects. That
is, the putative effect of past normal stress history should be most simply found by
subjecting the surface to a normal stress step while maintaining constant sliding ve-
locity. Figures 14 and 15 show some results of this procedure. In test RFT064 (Fig.
14), run on a surface that had been ground and run-in, the normal stress was suddenly
increased by 0.7 MPa while the sliding velocity was maintained constant at 10-6 m/s.
This sample had a slip gauge mounted across the joint, verifying that the velocity of
sliding remained constant during the normal stress increases. The result that the shear
stress is a square-wave function of the slip, just as is the normal stress, shows a lack of
significant effect of normal stress change.

  A marked effect of normal stress history was found, however, in test RFT077 (Fig.
15). This test surface was ground and run-in, also. No slip gauge was mounted on this
specimen so the slip velocity was calculated from the rotation rate as 10-5 m/s. The
finite initial slope of the shear stress-slip curve at the point of normal stress increase
indicates that the slip must have momentarily stopped. The onset of nonlinearity
marks the resumption of slip. The shear stress then evolves to a new higher level over
a slip distance of order 2 mm. It is thought that this brief (not more than a few
seconds) period of stationary contact does not alter the conclusion that a true effect
of normal stress history is shown. In any case, if some time-dependent strengthening
occurred during this period of no slip, it should have the effect of increasing the amount
of observed instantaneous shear stress increase. The test record for RFT077 gives
(~~/~~)state = 0.31, d~ss/d~ = 0.8, and a slip distance, LV, for the transient increase
of about 1.85 mm.

  The data from this type of test is not yet systematic enough to determine why some
tests show a fading memory effect and others do not. The differences between the two
