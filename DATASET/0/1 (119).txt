MILFORD AREA MEDIATION PROGRAM 
1996 

Last year the Town of Greenville most generously 
donated the sum of $500.00 to help the mediation program in 
its efforts to continue to provide this most needed free service 
to Greenville families. 

The Milford Area Mediation is a service of the Town of 
Milford and provides mediation services free of charge to any 
family residing in Greenville. From July 1, 1995 through June 
30, 1996 the Milford Area Mediation Program provided 
mediation services free of charge to fourteen (14) residents of 
Greenville. 

It is because of the Town of Greenville's continued 
financial support that the Milford Area Mediation Program can 
continue to provide this free service to Greenville families. 
Sincerely, 

Ellen Gardent, Coordinator 
Milford Area Mediation Program
