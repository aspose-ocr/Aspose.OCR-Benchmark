money from the grant is used to offset the tax rate. The cost 
of the grant is included in this year's budget, where last year it 
was not. 

The police department has only increased its budget 
twice in the last six years. The result is the department has 
experienced a heavy turnover of employees because we are not 
able to pay competitive wages. The average tenure for a police 
officer in Greenville is about 20 months. Of 20 months, 4 are 
spent in training. This results in an investment of over 
$9000.00 before the officer performs his or her first hour of 
service. 

The increase in the budget over and above the GRANT 
costs, is for increased pay for the officers. Of the police 
agencies in Hillsborough County, we have the third lowest 
starting pay and second lowest ending pay. The goal is to be 
competitive, so officers remain with the community for longer 
periods of time. This does not mean that officers must be the 
best paid. It does, however, require a fair balance test between 
cost of the service and the benefit to the community of a quality 
work force. 

Thank you for your continued support and help. 

Sincerely, 

David L. Benedict, Chief of Police
