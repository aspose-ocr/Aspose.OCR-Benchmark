  A special provision is provided, through OUTPUH and OUTPUV, for
punching the spectral values in the format (8F9.5) for later X-Y
plotting. Both the acceleration and the velocity spectrum are punched
when this option is used.

  The computation of spectra is a relatively expensive operation
which should be used with moderation.

Amplification Functions

  Printer plots of the Fourier amplification functions defined by
Eq. 10 for the free field or Eq. 15 for nodes not on the rigid base can
be produced through the input variables NOUT, OUTPUD, OUTPUV or KOUT.
The plots, one of which is shown in the output for the example problem
contains all points up to the cut-off frequency ~max = TOTFR. Points
computed by Gaussian elimination have the signature "C" and interpolated
points are shown as "*".

  The plots are useful for estimating the important natural frequen-
cies of the system and the adequacy of the interpolation scheme. They
also show, in the left margin, the actual frequencies where Gaussian
elimination was used. These frequencies will usually be somewhat lower
than the frequencies corresponding to those selected by the user through
the input variables FRKINT(I) and KINT(I). Allowance should be made for
this shift when the above input variables are selected.

Bending Moments

  Maximum values of the two bending moments and the maximum shear and
normal force are always printed in tabular form for all beam elements.
These values are usually sufficient for design.

  Printer plots of time histories of bending moments and axial force
can be requested through the input variables MMOUT and NBEMM. Punched
time histories can be requested but setting IIP = 1. This type of output
is most conveniently generated on a MODE2 run with a high value of the
skip paramet~~, NSKIP. All points of the time histories will be punched
in the format (8E10.3) with the same time step as the control motion.
