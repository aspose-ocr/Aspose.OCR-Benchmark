generation, and element and boundary condition specification.
Each of the data sets is terminated by an END card. The last
END card (i.e., the third), ends the setup portion of the program
and readies the program for the next command card.

Material Data Cards

  The material data cards are of two types corresponding to
the specification of fluid and matrix (solid) properties, res-
pectively. For the specification of the fluid properties, the
data cards are of the following form:

	[Material Name], number, ~f, ~f, cf, ~f,
	~, g, temperature dependence, Tref

where,

	Material Name: is an optional alphanumeric material name for
	  user reference.
	number: is the internal reference number for the material.
	  For the fluid property card, number must be set to 1.

	~f: is the fluid density.
	~f: is the fluid dynamic viscosity.
	cf: is the fluid specific heat.
	~f: is the fluid thermal conductivity
	~:  is the fluid volumetric expansion coefficient
		(= ~[~(1/~)/~T]p = -(1/~)[~~/~T]p).
	g:  is the gravitational acceleration.

	Temperature dependence <CONSTANT>: prescribes the depen-
	  dence of the fluid properties on temperature. If all
	  fluid properties (~, ~, and ~) are independent of
	  temperature, this parameter is omitted or set equal
