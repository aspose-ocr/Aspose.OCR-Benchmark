loge units. Upon conversion back to standard units, the "standard
deviation" is no longer symmetrical about the mean, as is evident by
examination of Table 5 and Figure 14. In fact, the 95% confidence limits
on the mean expansion behavior that are shown in Figure 14 have been
calculated in loge units and converted to standard units before
plotting.

  Thermal expansion measurements have been made on three large [5-inch
(12.7-cm) diameter] samples of lithophysae-rich Topopah Spring Member
(Nimick, in preparation, b). The average coefficients of linear thermal
expansion for the temperature ranges 30~ to 50~C (86~ to 122~F) and 50~
to 100~C (122~ to 212~F) are 4.65 ~ 10-6~C-1 (2.58 ~ 10-6~F-1) and
5.74 ~ 10-6~C-1 (3.19 ~ 10-6~F-1), respectively. These values are
lower than either set of coefficients in Table 5, despite the fact that
the larger samples were tested under confining pressure. The lower
values for the lithophysae-rich material are attributed to the presence
of the lithophysal cavities. It is postulated that these open spaces
absorb some of the mineral expansion in much the same way as the micro-
cracks discussed earlier in this section.

  2.3.2.2 Heat Capacity. No experimental data have been obtained for
the heat capacity of the tuff units at Yucca Mountain. Tillerson and
Nimick (1984, p. 86) assumed a constant value of 0.84 J/g~C (0.20 Btu/
lb~F) for the solid portion of all of the tuff units. However, empirical
estimates of the heat capacity from whole rock bulk chemistry indicate
that 0.84 J/g~C (0.20 Btu/lb~F) is not a representative value and that
the heat capacity has a relatively strong temperature dependence
(Connolly, 1986).
