PART I.
THE ARMENIAN MASSACRES AND THE
TREATY or BERLIN.

Since the gathering of the Plenipotentiaries of Europe at the famous
Congress of Berlin in 1878, and the signing of the still more famous Treaty
ofBerlin, the martyr roll of the unfortunate Armenian nation stands without
its parallel in history.

In the Guildhall at Berlin hangs a picture of the memorable scene
witnessed in that city 011 July the thirteenth 1878 The painter has depicted
the proud army of representatives of the poweiful Governments of Europe,
but 111 the interests of Humanih the1e should be attached to that painting
the wording ofA1ticle 61 of the Treat) of Berlin written in letters of blood
(Armenian blood).

It “as a curious irony of Fate, that although the taking of “the
terrible stronghold of Kars,” universally admitted to be one of the greatest
and most difﬁcult military exploits e1 er achieved, and the crowning success
ofthc Russian arms in Asiatic Turkey, should have been accomplished by
an Armenian General; that although Armenian Generals in the Russian
service had led to conquest, and Armenian soldiers fought, conquered and
died, yet by these successes not only was no amelioration attained of the
hard fate of their unhappy nation under Turkish rule, but that fate, hard
before, was made a hundredfold and even a thousandfold harder

GENERAL PRINCE LOhIS MELIKOFF.

Conunanded the Russian forces in Asiatic Turkey
during the Russo-Turkish war and captured the i111-
prcgnnble fortress of Kars. Appointed Prime Minister
of Russia by Alexander II. The liberal policy which
characterized the reign of that excellent 111011111'011, and
the Constitution that he was on the eve of granting to
his people were influenced by Melikoﬂ; but after the
death of Alexander II he was not allowed to continue in
his good work of reforming Russia, being overthrown
from ofﬁce early in the reign of Alexander HI.
