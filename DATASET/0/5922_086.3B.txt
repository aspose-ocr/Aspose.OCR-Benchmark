data for pure phases. Data are currently being collected for pure
zeolite minerals to allow calculation of the thermal expansion behavior
of zeolitic tuffs.
  Because of the presence of variable amounts of hydrous phases, such
as clays, zeolites, glass, and opaline silica, three temperature ranges
must be defined for the thermal expansion behavior of the tuffs from
Yucca Mountain: pretransition, transitional, and posttransition. For
the welded, devitrified Topopah Spring Member, the transitional behavior
is caused by a mineralogic phase change, while mineral dehydration causes
the variation in tuffs containing significant quantities of hydrous
minerals. Transdehydration behavior for samples containing significant
amounts of the various hydrous phases (e.g., zeolitized tuffs) is likely
to vary with the amount of expansion or contraction caused by heating and
the temperature range over which dewatering (dehydration) takes place.
  The three paragraphs that follow summarize the currently available
studies of thermal expansion behavior in silicic tuffs from Yucca
Mountain to document the data used in horizon selection analyses and to
provide data for evaluation of far field thermomechanical behavior. This
behavior is also illustrated in Figure 18 to allow comparison of the
response of the different tuffs.
  The Bullfrog and Tram Members are devitrified welded tuffs, generally
found below the static water level. Because of the relatively uniform
mineralogy involved, expansion behavior of devitrified welded tuffs from
below the static water level is quite uniform, except for effects of
small amounts (generally less than five percent) of expandable clays
(Bish, 1982; Waters and Carroll, 1981). Confined and unconfined results
