to the lands or waters of Indian reservations and so, the reserved rights were
superior to appropriations made under state law. In some of the later Indian
cases, the courts appear to base their decision on the theory that the Indians
reserved water rights in the treaties (U.S., 1956). In other cases, the courts
appear to have regarded the federal government as reserving land and water
from the public domain for the Indians (U.S., 1907; U.S., 1939). It is unclear
whether the courts in the latter cases regarded the reservations made by the
federal government as made in the exercise of the property power, or the treaty
power.
