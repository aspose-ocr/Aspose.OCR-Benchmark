			PRELIMINARY


The techniques that are used to obtain the chlorine-36/chlorine isotope
ratios from tandem accelerator mass spectrometry measurements are
documented in a paper by Elmore et al. (1984).  That paper discusses the
calculation of the ratio of chlorine-36 to chlorine-35 + chlorine-37 in
the sample, in a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) chlorine-36 standard,
and in a reagent blank.  The isotope ratios are corrected for mass
fractionation, for background, and for interferences arising from the
presence of sulfur-36.  The NBS chlorine-36/chlorine ratios are used to
normalize the ratios in the samples for inaccuracies introduced by the
tandem accelerator.  The value of the final chlorine-36/chlorine ratio in
the sample is calculated as the mean of the correct~~ and normalized
ratios from a sequence of measurements, weighted ~~ th~ uncertainty of
each determination, which is taken to be the larg~~ o~ t~~ internal or
external error.
