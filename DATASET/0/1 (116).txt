WILTON RECYCLING CENTER 
1996 

With most of the figures in at the time of this writing, it 
looks like the total tonnage handled rose form 3.004 in 1995 to 
3.471 in 1996 - an increase of sixteen percent. The per capita 
cost of trash disposal increased from $17.47 in 1995 to $21.28 in 
1996. The two biggest factors here look to be lower market 
prices and a huge increase in the use of our landfill dumpsters - 
up twenty two percent. 

The good news is that our ratio of recycled materials to 
non-recycled rose from thirty five percent in 1995 to thirty 
seven percent in 1996. 

With the continued cooperation of the Wilton 
Selectmen, the folks at the Town Office, the Wilton Highway 
Department, and those who use the Center, we look forward to 
a pleasant and productive 1997. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Joe Paro 
Manager
