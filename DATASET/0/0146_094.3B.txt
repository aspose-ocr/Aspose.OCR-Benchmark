3.1.5


  For the Case 4 Fuel Cycle it is assumed that a decision is made in year 2000. In Case 4A
a repository is assumed to be available by that date and spent fuel shipments to the repository
start immediately. In Case 4B a 10-year period is required before reprocessing can start at
which time shipments to the repository also start.

		3.1.5 Delayed Repository Availability

  Another fuel cycle alternative considers the possibility of a substantial delay in the
availability of a geologic repository. Repository availability in the year 2000 is assumed.

  In the case of the once-through cycle the impact is an increased requirement for spent
fuel storage. Although the reason for the delay is different, the effect on facility require-
ments is the same as a deferred decision to dispose of spent fuel as a waste (Case 4A) and a
separate case is not developed.

  In the case of reprocessing, the cycle proceeds as in the uranium and plutonium recycle
case (Figure 3.1.3) except that substantial interim storage facilities are required to hold
the packaged waste products until a geologic repository is available. This concept is identi-
fied in this report as the Case 3B Fuel Cycle.
