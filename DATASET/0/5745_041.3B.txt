  PRODUCTION AND OUTLOOK

  Nevada is the fifth largest gold-producing State, with a total output 
of 27,057,000 ounces from 1859 to 1962. The State ranked seventh
in production in 1962, when only 62,863 ounces were mined.
  The gold mining industry in Nevada exemplifies the general trend
of gold production in the United States, which has steadily declined
from a high of more than 4.5 million ounces in 1940 to 1.5 million
ounces in 1962 (U.S. Bureau of Mines preliminary data), the lowest
peacetime output since 1884. This may be contrasted with the world
gold production of 50 million ounces in 1962, a record high. Factors
responsible for diminishing production of gold in the United States are
the gradual depletion of high-grade deposits and constantly increasing
costs under a fixed selling price of $35 per ounce. As a result of this
situation, a steadily increasing portion of domestic gold output is a
byproduct of base metal mines.
  Figure 24 shows Nevada's gold-mining history since 1880 in terms
of annual production. Most of the bonanza production of the Com-
stock (No. 67, fig. 23) occurred before systematic annual records were
kept; consequently, the impact of this district cannot be shown. The
high production from 1906 to 1916 is due mainly to the tremendous
output of Goldfield (No. 12) during this period. After the decline of
Goldfield, gold mining generally waned in the 1920's and early 1930's,
but during this period there occurred a marked transition in the source
of gold from predominantly gold-bearing lodes to byproduct gold,
mainly from the copper ores of Ely (No. 70). With the increase in
the price of gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce in 1934, interest in gold
mining was renewed, and many lode districts were reopened. The
large output of the Getchell mine in Potosi district (No. 25) is re-
flected in the peak of almost 400,000 ounces in 1940. The post-World
War II period has been one of general diminishing activity, marked
by short-lived spurts of production due to large-scale placer operations
at Round Mountain (No. 57), large-scale open pit mining at the
Goldacres pit in the Bullion district (No. 29), and at the Getchell
mine (No. 25), in addition to significant sustained amounts of by-
product gold from Ely.
  Under current high costs, plus the fixed price of gold, a revival of
gold mining in Nevada comparable to the 1906-16 era hardly seems
likely. The known rich bonanza ore bodies are, for the most part,
exhausted. Any significant increase in gold output will probably be
either from byproduct gold or from large-scale mining of low-grade
lode or placer gold deposits. Rejuvenation of silver and silver-lead
mining in such districts as Comstock, Tonopah, and Eureka, or a
sharp increase in copper output at Ely would most certainly boost gold
production to several times its current rate.
  The closing of the Goldacres open pit mine in 1961 marked the
end of significant production from lode gold mines in Nevada; how-
ever, the recent resumption of activity at the Getchell mine in the
Potosi district may very well herald a new approach to gold mining
wherein high costs are combated by bold and imaginative planning
and a willingness to invest in and develop techniques for mining large
low-grade ore bodies, for extracting gold and all useful byproducts
from complex ores, and for exploring for concealed ore bodies.
