place at a relatively high strain rate and locally produced strong stratal rota-
tions and closely spaced normal faults, the faults themselves being rotated to 
relatively low dips. In those areas where extreme regional erosion, coupled 
with continuous isostatic rise, has been at play for 5 to 10 m.y. (as in the 
Sonoran Desert section), these structures (as noted above) are found to termi-
nate downward at large-scale, subhorizontal detachment surfaces or zones of 
extreme cataclasis and/or ductile shear, some of which developed prior to the 
onset of extension (Compton et al 1977, Coney 1979, Davis &Coney 1979, 
Davis et al 1979, Rehrig et al 1980). While the ductile flow of these rocks in 
some places clearly predated the initiation of extension, temperatures during 
the extensional episode were sufficiently high to reset radiometric clocks and, 
in other places, apparently remained high from the time of compression to the 
time of extension.

Role and Origin of Large-Scale Detachment Surfaces 

Initiation and maintenance of horizontal shear at the level of such detachments 
probably stemmed from increased shear stress, owing to reduction in lateral 
support in the shallow crust-~the result of thermal expansion, uplift (and the 
related increase in surface area that such uplift brings because of a local, 
incremental increase in earth radius), and lithospheric extension at depth. It 
was further served by a lowered shear strength, stemming from (a) the pres-
ence of zones of strong anisotrophy, inhomogeneity, and stress concentration 
that were created by earlier episodes of compressional thrusting and decol-
lement, as well as by mechanical layering, particularly the presence of ductile 
layers within, at the base of, and below the sedimentary pile that thins against
the massive buttress of the North American craton to the east; and (b) high 
pore pressure at the base of the brittle faulted column, its presence reflected 
in a compressional wave velocity inversion and elevated electrical conduc-
tivity (Eaton 1980).  At deeper levels, beneath the reheated mylonites or 
metamorphic rocks that underlie the normal faults (and across which a strong, 
shear stress gradient existed), extension is believed to have taken place by 
inhomogeneously distributed, uniform flow, the result of thermal pre-
weakening of the lithosphere by repeated magmatic invasion.  Known zones of 
inherited compressional decollement originated in pre-Tertiary time and early 
Tertiary time, but crustal temperatures high enough for extensional flow at 
natural strain rates, even at shallow lithospheric levels, apparently were main-
tained from the time of compression until at least mid-Cenozoic time when 
brittle extension, basaltic volcanism, regional uplift, and, locally, erosion and 
rapid cooling began.

Rheological Considerations

and one of possible remobilized uniform flow by steady-state creep at depth,
