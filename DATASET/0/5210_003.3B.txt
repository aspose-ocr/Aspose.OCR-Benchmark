                         FULL-WAVE ACOUSTIC LOG 

  The log on the left of Figure 1 illustrates one of the more recent geophysical
logs to be offered by the commercial logging companies. It is a full-wave 
acoustic log. The log shown is a Birdwell log which this company offers under 
the commercial name 3-D (Bird, 1965). In essence it is a recording of the 
sonic wave train for a period of time displayed as a variable intensity record-
ing. Whereas the sonic log shown in Figure 1 is essentially a recording of the 
time of first arrival of a sonic pulse through the rock at some fixed sender-to-
receiver distance (which is displayed as the time through the rock divided by 
the distance of travel or the reciprocal velocity), the 3-D log is a record of 
the wave train for some time after the first arrival. The dynamic elastic moduli
of the medium can be calculated from this log when used in conjunction with 
a density log. These moduli are Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk mod-
ulus, and Poisson's ratio.
  The full-wave recording logs offer the first opportunity to obtain dynamic 
elastic moduli on a sufficiently small scale to allow comparisons to be made 
with core data. Such comparisons indicate that significant relationships exist 
among the acoustic properties of volcanic rocks.
