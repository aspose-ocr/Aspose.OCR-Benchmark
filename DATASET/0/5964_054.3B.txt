1.2.1.1 EXCAVATION
Preclosure

DEFINITION:

The system for providing adequately supported repository horizon openings
and the shafts or declines for accessing the horizon.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. To provide entry/egress opening(s) between surface and underground
   portions of the repository for transferring radioactive waste,
   personnel, equipment, materials, utilities, ventilation air, and
   excavated rock.

2. To provide underground openings for waste handling and emplacement.

3. To provide underground openings for operation and support facilities.

4. To provide ground support where required.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA:

1. a. Number and size of access openings shall be sufficient to meet
      the repository needs in terms of handling radioactive waste,
      personnel, materials, equipment, utilities, and broken rock.

   b. Size, shape, and construction of access openings shall be
      adequate to supply and exhaust required volumes of air for
      subsurface operations.

   c. The necessary access openings shall be available for use of their
      specific purposes within the time frame specified in the
      repository schedule.

2. a. Size and layout of openings excavated shall be adequate to handle
      and emplace radioactive waste at a rate of up to 3000 MTU spent
      fuel and up to 400 MTU equivalent solidified high level waste.

   b. Excavation techniques shall ensure minimum overbreak of rock and
      minimum disturbance to the integrity of adjoining rock mass, and
      efforts shall be made to maintain as smooth a wall surface as
      practicable during excavation in order to assist ventilation by
      minimizing losses due to frictional resistance.
