obtained, they were recorded over relatively long intervals. Comparisons with
core values such as shown in Figures 2 and 3 were not appropriate because
of the large volumes of rock involved. However, full-wave acoustic logs permit
examination of shear velocities and dynamic moduli on a much smaller scale.
This enables comparisons of small-interval in situ readings with core values
obtained in the laboratory.
  Although data obtained from the 3-D log yield sufficient information on
elastic constants without resorting to logs other than density, it is desirable
for several reasons to attempt to relate these data to another log or less elabo-
rate combination of logs. This arises from the difficulty at times in obtaining
a shear velocity. To obtain the dynamic moduli, a shear velocity is needed.
Occasionally in the borehole the attenuation characteristics of the medium are
such that a shear wave is hard to discern on a 3-D log. In addition, the density
log is not always easily obtained due to borehole effects.
  Of the three variables -~ shear and compressional wave velocity and den-
sity -~ required to calculate dynamic moduli, the measurement most easily
