Vertical Boreholes

~    The boreholes will be drilled plumb within 5~ to the appropriate
     depth (see Subsection 5.1.5). The diameter of the boreholes will
     depend on the container and the closure methods used. The upper
     portion of the borehole may be enlarged to accommodate a protective
     liner.

~    The equipment will be designed to operate in a space no greater than
     that required for waste emplacement.

A more detailed description of the preliminary concept for the system,
equipment, and procedures for vertical emplacement and retrieval are provided
by Stinebaugh (1985). A detailed description of the drilling equipment is
provided by Robbins (1984).

Horizontal Boreholes

~   The boreholes will be drilled to a length that is consistent with
    retrieval, with the capabilities of the horizontal drilling machine
    and with other engineering considerations (see Subsection 5.1.5).

~   The boreholes will be lined to prevent loosened rock from falling
    into the borehole and to facilitate emplacement and retrieval.

~   The maximum deviation of the borehole will be 6 in. per 100 ft or no
    more than 12 in. over the entire length of the borehole.

~   It will be necessary to enlarge the borehole near the drift. The 
    details of this enlargement depend on the emplacement configuration
    and shielding method used.
