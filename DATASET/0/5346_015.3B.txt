HISTORICAL REVIEW OF SEISMIC REFLECTION SURVEYS DONE AT THE NEVADA TEST SITE


  Table 1 displays the field acquisition parameters used in gathering
seismic reflection surveys from the years 1972-1982 in the Nevada Test Site.
It also shows the survey location areas, geologic setting and estimate of the
reflection data quality. Table 1 indicates that most seismic reflection
surveys at the Nevada Test Site were acquired as two dimensional profiles
employing numerous input sources (Vibroseis1, Primacord2, Dynamite) and source
array patterns. Many different receiver arrays were also utilized. These
arrays were both short and long (up to 440 ft) and employed from 1 to 144
geophones. Our visual examination of the processed data revealed that the
profiles from areas usually characterized by complex faulting, volcanics and
paleozoic outcroppings (Yucca Mountain, Wahmonie, Calico Hills, and Syncline
Ridge) (Christiansen and Lipman, 1965, Lipman and McKay, 1965, Hoover, 1982,
Synder and Carr, 1982, and Pankratz, 1982) did not produce any accurate
reflection information. However, reflection data acquired in the flat lying
alluvial plain (Yucca Flat) which is not quite as complex geologically
appeared of much better quality.
  In 1982, a three dimensional seismic reflection survey was conducted at
Yucca Mountain utilizing a field technique that produced stack fold ranging
between 192 and 384. This report will illustrate that this very powerful
field technique also did not produce any interpretable reflection events.
