 1~So I would appreciate as much lead time as I can possibly
 2~get. It's just the mechanics of how to get them together
 3~into the same room.
 4~CHAIRMAN STEIN: Jerry, can we just get a date, can
 5~we just pick a date in August and shoot for that date?
 6~MR. SZYWEUSKI: Yes. We can try 26th and 27th.
 7~But I cannot promise.
 8~CHAIRMAN STEIN: How about the 27th and 28th?
 9~MR. SZYWEUSKI: That's right.
10~CHAIRMAN STEIN: Is that all right?
11~MR. SZYWEUSKI: Let me try. That's all I can --
12~MR. STABLINE: I haven't had a chance to work John
13~Greeves into the planning. It's his people who are involved.
14~The 27th or the 28th, John?
15~MR. GREEVES: I've got to start somewhere. So,
16~yes. And my problem is, you're asking for three of these type
17~meetings in August, so I was going to try and nudge you on
18~one of the three.
19~I was going to try and ask you if you could move the
20~SALT one out of August into September.
21~CHAIRMAN STEIN: Sure. I think that's a good idea.
22~MR. CASEY: No problem.
23~MR. GREEVES: 27th, 28th for Nevada.
24~CHAIRMAN STEIN: Let's pick an earlier date in
25~August for BWIP then.
