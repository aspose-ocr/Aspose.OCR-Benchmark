METHODS OF INVESTIGATION

       Between the NTS and the Ash Meadows discharge area the lower carbonate 
aquifer occurs alternately under confined ("artesian") conditions beneath the 
valleys and unconfined (water table) conditions beneath the knolls and ridges 
(Fig. 2).  If the water table was tens to a few hundred meters higher during 
Wisconsin (or earlier) time than the present highest potentiometric level at 
Ash Meadows (719 meters), it is probable that springs would have discharged 
directly from the lower carbonate aquifer at higher altitudes along the 
base or periphery of the numerous carbonate rock knolls and ridges in the region
between Ash Meadows and the NTS (Fig. 2).  In designing this study we assumed 
that had such discharge occurred some evidence of it would remain in the form 
of spring and spring-related deposits such as those found (and described below) 
at modern and known fossil springs.  This major assumption receives detailed 
discussion in a subsequent section.
      The study involved the following steps.  First, all known major springs 
between Ash Meadows and Death Valley were visited to observe the morphology 
of modern spring deposits.  Fossil tufa mounds adjacent to the modern springs at
King Spring in Ash Meadows (fig. 3) and at Nevares Spring in Death Valley (fig. 1) 
were also studied.  Second, fossil spring or tufa deposits, mapped by Denny and 
Drewes (1965) in the Ash Meadows area but not associated with modern springs, 
were visited and their morphology observed.  Third, valley-level outcrops of the
lower carbonate aquifer at altitudes of 720 to 940 meters were examined on foot 
and from light aircraft for evidence of tufa deposits (fig. 3) and calcitic veins
