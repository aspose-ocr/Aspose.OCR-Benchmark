Acknowledgments

     The writers are indebted to Industrial Minerals Ventures, Inc., for 
making available information from their extensive exploration of the 
Amargosa area for clay minerals.  Michael Collins, Richard Baird, and 
Jack Mayhew of that organization supplied drill-hole data and conducted 
tours of currently-operated clay pits.  We thank Margaret J. Baldwin for 
serving as our photographer at sites represented by figures 4-16 and 20-23.  
The review comments of W. J. Carr, R. L. Hay, D. I. Leap, B. F. Jones, 
W. G. Spaulding, W. C. Swadley, B. J. Szabo, and R. K. Waddell improved 
the manuscript and are appreciated.
