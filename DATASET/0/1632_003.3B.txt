ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

       The completion of this thesis would never have been
possible without the help of countless individuals, to each
of whom I am greatly indebted and forever grateful.
       Advisors in the preparation of this manuscript were
Roger Jacobson, Jack Hess, Paul Fenske, Peter Krenkel and
John Nelson.  Much help and criticism was given by them in
both the research and writing.
       Assistance in preparing the geology section of the
report was provided by Dean Townsend and Michael O'Brien of
Fennix and Scisson Engineering Company, Mercury, Nevada, who
supplied me with much useful descriptive information on the
tuffs and data on the physical characteristics of the mesa.
       Laboratory analysis of the water samples, both those
collected on the Nevada Test Site and those from the kinet-
ics experiments, were performed by the Water Analysis Labor-
atory of Desert Research Institute.  I am very grateful to
Shirlee Lewis, Patricia Harris and James Heidker for their
assistance in the analysis and suggestions for sampling
techniques.
       The analysis of the tuffaceous rock sample used in
the dissolution experiments was made possible with the help
of Patrick Beaulieu of the Nevada Analytical Laboratory.
