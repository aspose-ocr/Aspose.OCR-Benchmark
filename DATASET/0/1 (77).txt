GREENVILLE COMMUNITY CHANNEL 

COMMITTEE 

The Community Channel Committee met four times this 
year. We have not accepted paid ads recently because we need 
guidance from the Board of Selectmen regarding legal 
ramifications under the new Federal FCC laws. However, we are 
continuing to telecast Community Service announcements 
(Churches, Lioness, Scouts, Town Hearings and meetings, as 
well as Emergency Notices.) 

The Selectmen's weekly meetings are televised live every 
Wednesday. We have received enough feedback to know that 
we do have an audience. 

Expenses this year included a new TV monitor for the 
Selectmen's office, a new microphone, tripod and videotapes. 

We are pleased to report that necessary wiring has been 
completed to enable live TV presentations from the Library. We 
hope that by this time Cable will have been installed at the 
Elementary School as promised in the original contract. Ken 
Griffin, Elementary School Principal, has met with us several 
times urging the completion of this installation. 

Each Committee member has a special responsibility: 
Joanie keeps the scroll updated and also shows videos on 
Thursday nights; Mary sets up the weekly Selectmen's meetings, 
and arranges for taping of Water Hearings, Budget Hearings, etc.; 
Andy is continuing to work with the Historical Society on Early 
Postcards, and in televising local interest programs on Thursday 
night; Jamie is the cameraman, ready and willing to tape all 
Town activities. 

In connection with its Greenville History-125th 
Anniversary Studies, the Elementary School has carefully taped 
each monthly program. The Senior Citizen Tea video was 
shown several times and other segments will be shown as they 
become available. 

Please give us your criticism and suggestions for the best 
use of this valuable resource, 

Mary Pelletier 
Temporary Chairman
