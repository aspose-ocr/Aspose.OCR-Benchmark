FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Finance Committee started off this year with two 
remaining members from last year, and three new members. 
Increases in some of the budgets we reviewed are necessary and 
justifiable. However, some do not show real need, purpose, or 
urgency. Confronting the taxpayers this year, and for many 
years to come, will be the Greenville Water System with 
insurmountable problems. 

Souhegan Ambulance Service is a major concern. The 
committee has not reached any decision on the budget 
presented to us. The lack of information, direction, or future 
expenses that may be incurred cannot be addressed at this time. 
This will be reflected in budgets and warrant articles presented 
to you at this years town meeting. 

Only the voting body of this town can pass, and reject 
budgets or articles at Town Meeting. As individuals, the choice 
is yours to decide what you can afford, ultimately you carry the 
burden and responsibility of that choice. This is the process of 
our town government. Choose wisely. 

Respectfully submitted,
