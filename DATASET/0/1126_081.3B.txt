			APPENDIX A

	MANGANESE AND STRONTIUM THERMODYNAMIC DATA
		FOR THE EQ3/6 COMPUTER PROGRAM

  This appendix contains listings of the data file for manganese and
strontium thermodynamic data for the EQ3/6 computer program. For each
element, the MDAQS file lists aqueous species data, the MDSOL file provides
solid species data, the REAC file gives the chemical reactions involving the
new species and the other EQ3/6 basis species, and the DFILE file enumerates
the calculated equilibrium constants for these reactions.
