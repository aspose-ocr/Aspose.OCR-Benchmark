data may be stored and read from separate external files. Variable formatting
allows input data arrays to be read in any format without modification to
the program. The type of output that is available has also been generalized
so that the user may select various model output options to suit a particular
need. The program, which is written in FORTRAN '66, has been successfully
run without modification on computers manufactured by IBM, Control Data,
Prime, Amdahl, Digital Equipment, and Cray corporations.1/

  The major options that are presently available include procedures to
simulate the effects of wells, recharge, rivers, drains, evapotranspiration,
and general-head boundaries. The solution algorithms available include two
iteration techniques, the Strongly Implicit Procedure (SIP) and the Slice-
Successive Overrelaxation method (SSOR).

	Organization of This Report

  The purpose of this report is to describe the mathematical concepts used
in this program, the design of the program, and the input needed to use the
program. The program has been divided into a main program and a series of
highly independent subroutines called modules. The modules, in turn, have
been grouped into "packages." A package is a group of modules that deals
with a single aspect of the simulation. For example, the Well Package
simulates the effect of wells, the River Package simulates the effect of
rivers, and the SIP Package solves a system of equations using the Strongly
Implicit Procedure. Most of the packages are options which the user may
