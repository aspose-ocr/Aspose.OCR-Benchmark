	Diffusion was modeled using a three-dimensional, continuous
point source, transient-state, analytical model which allowed estimation
of the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous media, and an
independent assessment of the media's sorptive effects on the tracer
gas. The model was calibrated using least squares and curve matching
techniques, the latter of which enables a field technician to quickly
interpret observed field data.
	Field values obtained for effective diffusion coefficient ranged
from 0.026 to 0.037 cm2/sec. The average tortuosity factor observed for
test site was 0.705.
