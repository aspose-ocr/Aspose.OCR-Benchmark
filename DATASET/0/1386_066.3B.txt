   13.	The emplacement hardware is operated cold by the emplacement and
	retrieval of a simulated high level waste package. Sufficient cold
	runs are executed to ensure proper operation of all system
	components.

   14.	The emplacement system is certified by a quality control inspector
	as ready to accept high level waste.

   15.	The waste emplacement officer is notified that the borehole is
	ready to accept waste packages.

7.1.2.2 Emplacement of Waste in Horizontal Boreholes

   The following procedures will be used to emplace waste disposal
packages in horizontal boreholes:

   1.	Carrying the waste package in the facility cask, the transporter is
	driven to the emplacement hole.

   2.	The transporter turns into the alcove opposite the emplacement
	hole, backs up onto the docking platform, and engages with the
	automatic alignment system. The driver leaves the transporter,
	and the transporter is moved back by remote control until it is
	mated with the emplacement door. The transporter's automatic
	control system is then activated by making the required electrical
	connections via the shield door umbilical cord. At this time, all
	personnel move to the emplacement control station.

   3.	The cask lid is remotely unlocked and transferred to the shield
	door lifting system. The shield door and lid are raised simul-
	taneously until the cask-to-emplacement-hole passageway is
	unrestricted.

   4.	The powered roller system in the facility cask is activated and
	moves the waste package from the facility cask to a position just
	inside the shield door.
