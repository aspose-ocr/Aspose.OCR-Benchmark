                 Spring Mountains-Lathrop Wells area

  The Spring Mountains lie along the east edge of the map area.
The mountains trend northwest, and the outcropping pre-Cenozoic rocks
of the range are continuous westward through the Specter Range, the
Striped Hills, and the Skeleton Hills almost to Lathrop Wells. The
gravity high associated with this block extends almost continuously
from a point ~ ~~in Clark County, southeast of the map area
(M. F. Kane, written commun., 196~), to the west end of the block.
South and southeast of the Skeleton Hills the gravity high is connected
by a gravity ridge broken by two saddles to a high associated with the
pre-Cenozoic rocks in the Mount Shador area.

                           Mount Shador area
   
   The Mount Shador area, at the northwest end of the Spring Mountains,
includes the hills of outcropping pre-Cenozoic rocks that lie south of
the Specter Range, west of the Spring Mountains, and north of the Resting
Spring and Nopah Ranges. The gravity anomaly consists of a prominent
Y-shaped gravity high that trends north-northeast into the northern
Spring Mountains and northwest toward the Skeleton Hills. This high
is marked by two closed -105-mgal contours and a closed -110-mgal
contour. The two closed -105-mgal contours are partially separated
by a low (-110 mgals) that trends southwest from near Johnnie.

   The Resting Spring and Nopah Ranges are largely in California;
their locations are shown in the south-central part of figure 2. These
