Environmental Regulatory Compliance Plan will be prepared to address such

requirements during construction and operation of the repository.



3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL SITE SUITABILITY PLANS



	The Final Siting Guidelines, 10 CFR 960.1, were established for use in evaluating

suitability of sites for the development of repositories.  This suitability determination is

to be used for the major siting decisions, nomination and recommendation of candidate

sites for site characterization pursuant to 112(b) of the NWPA, the preliminary

determination of suitability required by Section 114(f), and the repository site selection.



	The EAs issued in May 1986 included the site-suitability analysis in Chapter 6.  At

the same time, the Secretary of Energy made a preliminary determination that the three

sites recommended for site characterization were suitable for development of

repositories.


	The NWPA, Sec. 113(b)(1)(A)(iv), directs the DOE to develop "criteria to be used to

determine suitability of such candidate site for the location of a repository, developed

pursuant to Section 112(a)."  For those guidelines that require site characterization, the

criteria required above will be included in the Site Characterization Plans.


	An Environmental Site Suitability Plan will be developed to provide criteria to be

used to determine suitability under the following guidelines:


		960.4-2-8-2	Human Interference

		960.5-2-2	Site Ownership and Control

		960.5-2-3	Meteorology
