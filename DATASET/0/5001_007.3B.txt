DRILL-HOLE LOCATION AND HISTORY

  Drill hole USW VH-2 is located in central Crater Flat (fig. 1) between
Red Cone and Black Cone at Nevada State coordinates N. 748,320 ft and
E. 526,264 ft. Surface elevation is 974.5 m (3,197 ft). The hole is located
approximately 2.7 km (1.7 mi) northwest of drill hole USW VH-1 (Carr, 1982),
slightly west of the northeast alignment of Quaternary basalt cinder cones.

  Fenix & Scisson, Inc., records show that drilling began February 15,
1983, and operations were completed on April 28, 1983. The hole was
continuously cored (HCQ - 3.937 in. diameter) from the bottom of surface
casing at 7 m (23 ft) to 1,219 m (4,000 ft) T.D. Polymer mud was used as a
drilling fluid. Core recovery was excellent, 100 percent in most intervals,
except in alluvium from the surface to a depth of about 100 m (330 ft). Even
in that interval, sidewall core, conventional core below about 61 m (200 ft),
cuttings and geophysical logs were sufficient to insure that no volcanic units
remained undetected. Casing (5 1/2 in.) was installed to 220 m (720 ft) and
1.9-in. pipe was set to a depth of 1,215 m (3,986 ft). A directional survey
shows that the hole deviated westward about 15 m (50 ft) from the vertical to
a depth of about 640 m (2,100 ft), and thence southeastward, so that the
bottom of the hole is about 12 m (40 ft) southwest of the surface location.
  No hydrologic testing was done in USW VH-2 because polymer mud was used
in the drilling.
