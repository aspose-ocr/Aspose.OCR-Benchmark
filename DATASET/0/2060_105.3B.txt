Narrative for Module BAS1FM

    This module initializes the arrays in which the right hand side (RHS) 
and the h-coefficient (HCOF) are accumulated.

    Recall that the equation for cell i,j,k contains a term RHSi,j,k on the 
right hand side and a coefficient HCOFi,j,k (h-coefficient) which multiplies 
hi,j,k on the left hand side of the equation.  The right-hand-side term and 
the h-coefficient are the sum of terms related to many of the flow components.  
They are calculated every time the equations are formulated.

    Module BAS1FM performs its functions in the following order:

    1.   For each cell, initialize (set equal to zero) the HCOF and RHS 
accumulators.

    2.   RETURN.
