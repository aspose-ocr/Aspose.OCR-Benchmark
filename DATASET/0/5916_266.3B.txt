aqueous species was also important. Rai and Serne (1978)
reported a solubility of 10-14m for pH values in the range 4
to 8 with the same dominant species as noted above. Linke and 
Seidell (1965) found a value of 10-10m for Zr solubility in
pure water with the hydroxide, Zr(OH)4, as the limiting solid
phase. The discrepancies between the calculated results given
here and the values of Rai and Serne may be due to the differ-
ence in thermodynamic data bases used in the calculations.

Technetium

  Tc exhibits behavior similar to Se in the SNLA calcula-
tions. Under oxidizing conditions a "high" solubility limit
was found with TcO~~ as the dominant aqueous species. In
reducing conditions, the solid TcO2 limits the solubility to
a value below 10-16m. Published data (Leiser and Peschke,
1982; Wildung and others, 1979; Apps and others, 1983) showed
similar contrasts between solubilities in reducing and oxidiz-
ing conditions (10-14m to >100m). Several species, such as 
TcO2+, TcO(OH)+, and TcO(OH)~~, considered as potentially
important by other researchers (Apps and others, 1983) were not 
considered in these calculations. Available thermochemical
data are not sufficient for the calculation of the 
concentrations of these species at the present time.

Palladium

  In the SNLA calculations, a solubility limit of 10-5.4m
was computed for Pd for all four Eh-pH conditions. This con-
stant value is equal to the ratio of the equilibrium constants
of the two dominant compounds Pd(OH)2 and Pd(OH)2(s). Other
researchers have reported the solubility of Pd to be very
sensitive to redox potential - a trend not detected in this
study. Apps and others (1983) found a solubility limit of
10-7m at Eh = +0.4 with PdO as the dominant solid. They
obtained a solubility equal to 10-22m at Eh = 0 volts with
Pd as the dominant solid phase. Neither of these two solids
were included in the data base for the SNLA calculation. This 
may account for the discrepancy in the reported solubilities.

Tin

  The solubility limits for Sn calculated by SNLA are low
and dependent only upon pH. At pH = 7 the solubility of Sn was
found to be 10-13.3m while at pH = 8.5 the solubility was
reduced to 10-14.8m. SnO(OH)F0 and SnO2 were found to be
the dominant aqueous species and dominant solid, respectively.
Previous studies reported a low solubility limit for Sn. For
example, Apps and others (1983) found a constant solubility of
10-9.3m over the pH range of 6 to 9. They found the dominant
aqueous species and solid phase to be Sn(OH)~~ and SnO2,
