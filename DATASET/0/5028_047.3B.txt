Spring Member of the Paintbrush Tuff, (B) the Prow Pass Member of the Crater 
Flat Tuff, (C) the Bullfrog Member of the Crater Flat Tuff, and (D) selected 
bedded intervals occuring at depths between 4,293 and 5,899 ft. Within the 
Topopah Spring, data points were collected between the intervals of 638 and 
654 ft, 729 and 738 ft, and 1,169 and 1,178 ft. The most pronounced foliation 
occurred within the lowermost of the three intervals.  As shown, the direction 
of dip of the foliation ranges from N. 73~ E. to S. 13~ E. by 4~ to as much as 
19~.  The average dip and direction is 10.5~ S. 74~ E.

      Although not as pronounced as in the Topopah Spring, foliated pumice 
fragments are also present within the Prow Pass Member at depths between 1,952 
and 1,957 ft and between 2,092 and 2,111 ft, correlative with subunits B and 
C, respectively (on fig. 6, symbols which correspond to the upper and lower 
intervals point north and south, respectively).  Foliation trends dip toward 
directions ranging from N. 46~ E. to S. 55~ E. by amounts varying from 5~ to 
17~.

       Only five structural attitude observations were made within the Bullfrog 
Member, at depths of 2,181.8, 2,183.3, 2,457.6, 2,462.0, and 2,463.0 ft, of 
which the upper two are inclined toward N. 85~ E. and the latter three between 
S. 29~ E. and S. 38~ E. Dips range from 5~ to 13~.

       In contrast to foliation trends, bedding planes below a depth of 4,293 ft
are commonly inclined less than 10~ in a preferred south to southwesterly 
direction.

Fractures

       Fracture frequencies, represented in columns 4 and 5 of plate 1, are 
segmented into two discrete subsets: joints and shear fractures.  As in 
earlier studies (Spengler and others, 1979; Spengler and Rosenbaum, 1980) 
joints are defined as fracture planes along which differential movements were 
not apparent during megascopic examination of the core.  Although similar in 
relative distribution and types of coatings, shear fractures, by definition, 
show evidence of movement in the form of minor offsets of pumice fragments and 
(or) striations and slickenside grooving on fracture faces.

Shear Fractures and Fault Zones

       A total of 61 shear fractures were recognized in core samples from USW-G1
between depths of 324.8 and 5,468.4 ft (col. 5, pl. 1).  Examination revealed 
that most shears are preferentially associated with particular rock types as 
well as with conspicuous fault zones.  Shears predominantly occur within the 
extensive densely welded zone of the Topopah Spring Member and in flow 
breccia, which contains the highest proportion.  This distribution undoubtedly 
reflects the behavior of highly brittle rock masses intercalated with softer, 
more pliable partially welded and nonwelded tuff units.

     Examination of shear-fracture inclinations revealed that 39 percent of 
the shears are preferentially inclined between 60~ and 80~ relative to the 
axis of the core (fig. 7).  Where obtainable, the rake of striations measured 
along these fracture faces suggests a sizable component of lateral movement
