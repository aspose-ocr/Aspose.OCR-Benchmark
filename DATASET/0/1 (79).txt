Increased responsibilities and the costs of monitoring cases of 
landowners who have chosen not to follow the state established 
standards of environmental laws have created expenses that we 
can no longer cover with out-of-pocket funds. 

We again wish to remind residents that a permit is 
necessary prior to any construction in, or alteration of, any flat, 
marshland, swamp, brook, or other wetland. 

For more information, attend a meeting. 

We meet in the courtroom at 7:30 pm the first 
Wednesday of each month. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Joanie MacPhee, secretary 
Marshall Buttrick, Chair 
Pat Nelson 
Jamie Taft alternate
