$12,000 for a feasibility study of the water system. The three 
areas that need to be addressed are: 

1. Treatment 

2. Storage 

3. Distribution 

Underwood Engineers has been hired to perform this study. 
Due to the age of the treatment facility, the water system 
experienced several major emergencies in 1996. We are 
addressing some of the more pressing problems in the near 
future. 

Unfortunately the last round of lead and copper testing 
done this past fall did not meet current copper and level 
standards, which will require us to do more frequent testing 
within the next year, 

The personnel have attended several work shops/seminars 
pertaining to safety, pump operations, hydrant operations and 
maintenance, defensive driving, confined space training, fire 
extinguisher training, CPR and first aid training, and numerous 
management/public relations. We invite you to visit all of our 
facilities at any time. We are open to any suggestions, or 
comments that would benefit the departments. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Charles Buttrick
