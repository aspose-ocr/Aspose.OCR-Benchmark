THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT

Safeguards and Security (Cont.)

Guard personnel are required to meet rigid physical standards.  The NTS is equipped with
a modern pistol and rifle range in Area 23 where the guards maintain their proficiency in
the use of weapons.  Certain guards used for sensitive assignments are also trained in
the operation of weapon-equipped armored vehicles.

All locations on the NTS containing special nuclear material are designated as special
security areas and utilize a combination from among the following to provide adequate
security:

Hardened facilities
Security fences
Internal alarms
External alarms
Closed circuit television (CCTV)
Guards
Response capability

Access Controls

The NTS is a controlled access area. Although it does not require a security clearance
to enter the site, access is controlled and restricted to those personnel who have been
properly identified and badged.

The security areas onsite have more stringent controls, requiring appropriate security
clearances and an operational need before unescorted access is allowed. Others having
a need for access are escorted.

c. Personnel Clearances

All personnel having access to SNM at NTS must either have security clearance in
accordance with ERDA regulations or be escorted by personnel who do possess the
proper clearance.
