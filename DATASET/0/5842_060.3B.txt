deviation between the two quantities becomes progressively greater till at
c = 2 the point of inflection is coincident with the origin of the isotherm.
  When c falls between 1 and 2, the point of inflection actually occurs at a
negative value of P, and so no longer corresponds to a point on the experi-
mental isotherm: the isotherm is then no longer of Type II but has become a 
clear Type III. If c lies between 0 and 1, the value of P at the point of 
inflection is imaginary; again, the isotherm is of Type III.

2.4 Application of the BET Equation to Type II Isotherms

The form of the BET equation most often applied to experimental data is 
that given in (2.37), viz.
According to this, when p/x(p0-p) is plotted against p/p0 a straight line
should result, with slope s = (c-1)/xmc and intercept i = 1/xmc. Solution
of the two simultaneous equations immediately gives xm and c:
  A few representative BET plots of Type II isotherms are given in Figs.
2.6-2.9. Those in Fig. 2.6 for nitrogen adsorption at -193~C on various
catalysts, taken from the original paper of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller(2),
are linear between relative pressures of about 0~05 and 0~35. On extra-
polation they pass close to the origin (a feature which is typical of nitro-
gen adsorption on oxides and hydrated oxides) and this indicates a
relatively large value of c, which is associated with the presence of a distinct
knee in the adsorption isotherm (p. 57). The isotherms and BET plots in
Fig. 2.7, obtained by Davis, DeWitt and Emmett(16), illustrate a case
where c is small (e.g. for n-C4H10, c = 5~4 at 0~ and c = 11~6 at -78~C).
The isotherm is much more rounded at the low pressure end and corre-
spondingly the intercept on the p/x(p0-p)-axis is further away from the
origin; the range of linearity is roughly the same as before, however.
  Contrary to what had at one time been supposed, the range of validity of
the BET equation does not always extend to relative pressures as high as
0~30 or 0~35. In Fig. 2.8 and 2.9 there are examples of BET plots which
begin to depart from linearity when the relative pressure exceeds 0~1. The
plots of Fig. 2.8 are taken from the recent work of Isirikyan and Kiselev(17)
on graphitized carbon black. The range of relative pressures over
which the BET plots were linear was 0~0003 to 0~09 for N2 at -195~; 0~04
