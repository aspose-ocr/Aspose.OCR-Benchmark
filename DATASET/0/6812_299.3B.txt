2.1.2.5		UNSATURATED PROW PASS




DEFINITION:


The UNSATURATED PROW PASS is that portion of the 2.1.2 FAR FIELD made up of

unsaturated Prow Pass welded tuff from thermal/mechanical unit PPw that lies

below the repository underground facilities.




FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:



1.	To provide groundwater flow and radionuclide retardation characteristics

	compatible with isolation of the radioactive waste emplaced in the Yucca

	Mountain MGDS.


2.	To provide a pre-waste-emplacement groundwater travel time compatible with

	that of other 2.1.2 FAR FIELD components.




PERFORMANCE CRITERIA:



1.	Groundwater flow and radionuclide retardation in the UNSATURATED PROW PASS

	shall combine with other 2.1.2 FAR FIELD components to meet the

	radionuclide release, groundwater protection, and individual protection

	requirements identified in 2.1.2 PC#1.


2.	Groundwater flow in the UNSATURATED PROW PASS shall combine with other

	2.1.2 FAR FIELD components to meet the groundwater travel time requirement

	identified in 2.1.2 PC#2.




CONSTRAINTS:



None identified at this level.
