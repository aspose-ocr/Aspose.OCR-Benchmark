III. General Characteristics

Operating Characteristics - The STAGS program comprises three separate
executable programs, STAGS1, STAGS2, and STAPL. STAGS1 reads the input
data cards prepared by the user and prepares files required to plot the
discrete model and execute STAGS2. The STAGS2 program executes the
numerical computations for static or dynamic analysis. The STAPL pro-
gram prepares plots of the model geometry and solution data using files
created by STAGS1 or STAGS2. Operating experience indicated that the
local files created by STAGS1 containing model data were too bulky to be
conveniently retained on disk-type permanent files. Accordingly, each
execution of STAGS2 is preceded by an execution of STAGS1 with card
format input. The program is written in FORTRAN.

Inputs - The input quantities are very extensive because six analysis
types are available. Over 120 pages are used to specify the input re-
quirements from cards. In addition to the cards, STAGS can accept input
in the form of user-written subroutines that extend the generality and
complexity of the program. Those subroutines are described in 65 pages
of the user's instructions volume.

The input cards are in the following categories:

~ Summary and control parameters

~ Computational strategy parameters

~ Data tables
