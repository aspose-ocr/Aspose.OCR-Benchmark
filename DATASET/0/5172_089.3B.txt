with elevation. The Q1c soil at the lowest elevation in the
transect has over 2% CaCO3 accumulation at 9-60 cm, whereas at
greater elevations on the transect, the CaCO3 accumulation is much
less (<0.3%). In addition the depth at which the maximum CaCO3
occurs in each profile, is deeper with higher elevation. Therefore,
with increasing precipitation the CaCO3 decreases in amount and the
depth of maximum accumulation increases. The increase in frequency
and amount of precipitation in the modern climate at the upper end
of the transect is sufficient to translocate the CaCO3, but
insufficient at the lower end.
  If the climate in the past has been similar to the Holocene,
CaCO3 accumulation should occur at similar depths along the transect
in the older soils. Significant variations in the CaCO3 depths
observed in older soils should reflect differences in amounts of
effective moisture.
  The CaCO3 in the soils formed on Q2b deposits does not have
the predicted response. Generally CaCO3 increases rather than
decreases in amount, and increases to depth of maximum accumulation
with increasing elevation (Fig. 20). The CaCO3 in soils formed on
Q2c deposits has a similar response with some reversals, however the
two highest soils are nearly at the same elevation (Fig. 21).
Although, generally the soils at lower elevations have far less
CaCO3 (1-2%) than the soils at higher elevations (18-23%), and the
depth to maximum accumulation increases with elevation. The soils
formed on QTa deposits do not show an obvious trends with increasing
elevation (precipitation) (Fig. 21). Irrespective of elevation,
detectable CaCO3 first occurs at a depth of 10 to 30 cm. This could
