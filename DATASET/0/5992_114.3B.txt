and Koch, 1969); thus the neutral complex, TcO(OH)2~, is likely to be
the dominant solution species.

     Figure 2.8 shows the results of calculations for technetium.  Calcul-
ations were made for three redox conditions, Eh = +0.2, 0.0, and -0.2 V.
The symbols (S) and (A) denote the calculated controlling solid phase and
major solution species, respectively.  It was not possible to calculate
the contribution of reduced aqueous species, i.e., TcO2+, TcO(OH)+, and
TcO(OH)2~ to the solubility, since the necessary data are not available.

     (3) Palladium.  Palladium normally exists only in the divalent and
tetravalent states in solution, but Pd4+ is much less stable than Pd2+,
and the divalent ion dominates its solution chemistry.  The element is
found with the other platinum metals in nature as alloys, as well as
special minerals like braggite (mixture of Pt, Pd, and Ni sulfides).  The
chloride, nitrate, and sulfate of Pd2+ are soluble and the fluoride
sparingly soluble.  The oxide, hydroxide, and sulfide of Pd2+ are quite
insoluble, with solubility products of 10-32.4, 10-28.5, and ~ 10-25,
respectively.  There is no information on the phosphates, silicates, or
carbonates; however, NiCO3 (Ni is in the same chemical group as Pd) is
sparingly soluble.  If the behavior of Ni is indicative, Pd would be
expected to form only weak complexes with SO4-, F-, NO3-, and HPO~~~.
Palladium forms strong complexes with OH- and Cl-.  Values of 1013.0 and
1025.0 have been reported for the first and second hydrolysis constants,
respectively, of Pd2+ and 10-5.4 for the reaction Pd(OH)2(c) = Pd(OH)2~(aq).
The values for ~1, ~2, ~3, and ~4 of the chloride complexes were reported
as 106.1, 1010.7, 1013.1, and 1015.4.

     Figure 2.9 shows the results of calculations for palladium.  The
symbols (S) and (A) denote the calculated controlling solid phase and major
solution species, respectively.  Calculations were made for Eh values: 0.0,
+0.2, and +0.4 V.

     (4)  Tin.  The 2+ and 4+ oxidation states are the important ones for
tin in aqueous solution.  The 4+ state is particularly stable in the
natural environment, and cassiterite (SnO2), which usually occurs in low-
grade ores, is the major source of the element.

     Tin dioxide is quite insoluble, but little quantitative data exists
on its solubility.  The solubility product has been estimate to be 10-64.4.
SnO (Ksp = 10-26.2) is more soluble than SnO2 but is unstable toward
oxidation by water to SnO2 and would not be important in natural systems.
The fluorides, chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates of both stannous and
stannic are soluble, but the stannous (Ksp = 10-25.9) and stannic sulfides
are not.  There is no good value for the solubility product of SnS2,
although stannite (Cu2S~FeS~SnS2), canfieldite (4Ag2S~SnS2), and
teallite (Pbs~SnS2) have been found with the other metal sulfide deposits
in nature.  There is no information on the phosphates, carbonates, or silicates,
but none occur naturally.  One might expect the oxide or sulfide as the
controlling solid phase for Sn4+.
