SELECTMEN'S NARRATIVE 

The year 1996 was an eventful year for Greenville, 
especially for the Water and Sewer Departments. The Town 
entered into an intermunicipal agreement with the Greenville 
Estates Village District which covered the construction of the 
sewer line extension along Route 31 from Mill Street to Old

The Board of Selectmen takes this opportunity to thank all 
department heads for controlling spending increases for the 
coming year.

in lower water production. The heavy snowstorm in December 
resulted in a power outage at the water treatment plant which 
required the help of most of our public works employees, the 
fire department and the NHDES in order to provide limited and 
untreated water service to the Town. These events would not
