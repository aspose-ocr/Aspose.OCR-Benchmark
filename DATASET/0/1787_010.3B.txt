		II. INTRODUCTION

Because light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel cannot be accumulated indefi-
nitely in reactor or other storage basins, it will eventually become neces-
sary either to reprocess the fuel or to dispose of it in geologic reposito-
ries. Engineered barriers will be utilized in geologic repositories to
prevent interaction of the fuel with the repository environment and, subse-
quently, transmission through the geology, and possible escape of fission
products and actinides into the biosphere. It is assumed that the protective
barriers will eventually fail and air and/or groundwater will contact the
fuel rods. If the fuel rod cladding is defective or fails, oxidation and/or
leaching/dissolution of the fuel could release certain long-lived fission
products and actinides into the repository. To estimate the magnitude of
these releases, a knowledge of spent fuel characteristics that affect its
interactions with the waste package and the repository environment is
required. This information will be used to establish repository acceptance
criteria, spent fuel handling procedures, and package design requirements.

With these considerations in mind, the present report provides data, where
available, on the pertinent characteristics of spent LWR fuel.
