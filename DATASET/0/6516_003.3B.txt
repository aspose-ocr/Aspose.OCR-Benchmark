30 days before the test is initiated.  These test procedures will
contain a level of detail consistent with standard procedures
applied to a given technical area and will identify each of the
technical steps to be carried out during the test.  The test
procedures will indicate the specific steps that will be taken for
quality assurance purposes.

	The "Content Requirements" document for studies has been modified
to accommodate the information requested by the NRC in the
December 12, 1985 letter from Linehan to Alexander (NRC markup of
DOE Content Requirements of Studies in Chapter 8 of the SCP),
with the exception of one point concerning alternatives.   The
revised "Content Requirements for Descriptions of Studies" is
included as Attachment B.  The advantages and limitations of the
various alternative test and analysis methods will be discussed
in the supporting references.  However, the advantages and
limitations of the various alternative test numbers, locations,
durations and timing, and will not be discussed because all tests
selected will be evaluated to assure that the resulting data will
be adequate for meeting the objectives of the test.

	In addition, the DOE has written "Content Requirements For
Descriptions of Investigations in Chapter 8 of the SCP"
(Attachment C).  Both "Content Requirements" descriptions
(Attachments B and C) serve as an expansion of information listed
in Table 2 of the AO and are consistent with Section 8.3 of the
AO.  It should be noted that both "Content Requirements"
documents do not prescribe a format for presenting the required
information, either in the SCP or in study plans.  In the SCP,
the information of Attachment C will be formatted according to
the AO.  A common format has not been established for the study
plans.  A comparison chart is provided (Attachment D) showing the
modifications to the "Content Requirements" that have been made
in going from the studies level to the investigations level.
