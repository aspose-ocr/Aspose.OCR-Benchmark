Blast planning
It is not unusual for tunnel constructors to fail to
consider the effects of the charges in the rows
adjacent to the often well-planned smooth blasted
contour row. Charging the adjacent rows with a
heavy charge results in cracks spreading further
into the remaining rock than from the smooth
blasted row. It is better to optimize the charge
calculations such that the damage zone from any
hole in the round will not exceed the damage zone
from the contour holes. This can easily be done by
use of Fig. 2(a), where the damage zone is given
for different charge concentrations.
  Table 2 contains recommended burdens for some
Swedish explosives for use in smooth blasting. For
a hole diameter of 48 mm and 17-mm GURIT pipe
charges, a burden of 0.8 m is normal. From Fig.
2(a) we find that this charge will result in a damage
zone of about 0.3 m. Choosing a fully charged hole
of ANFO (/ = 1.6 kg/m) in the next row with a
damage zone of 1.5 m is of no value because this
results in a damage zone that extends 0.4 m further
into the rock (1.5-0.8-0.3 = 0.4 m) than the
damage zone from the GURIT charges. It would be
better to use a charge concentration that results in
a damage zone equal to that caused by the GURIT
plus the burden, i.e. 1.2 m (Fig. 5) - such a charge
should have / = 0.8-1.2 kg/m.


It is apparent from this example that a reduction
of the damage zone can be obtained by a reduction
of the charge concentration per metre borehole.
This obviously results in increased costs for drill and
blast operation, but these are balanced by the
advantage of a safer roof and decreased costs for
grouting and maintenance.
