R. M. Zimmerman         -5-            December 11, 1985


Zimmerman and Vollendorf (1982) observed that the relationship between
~Qh and ~D approached linearity only at higher values of Qh.
They chose to use the range of Qh of 48 to 65.5 MPa (7000 to 9500 psi)
to calculate ~Qh/~D.  If the same pressure range is used to
calculate corrected values of Et, the result is Et = 17.56 ~~
8.13 GPa.  This mean value is 65 percent higher than the uncorrected 
mean from Zimmerman and Vollendorf (1982).

Historically, the test data to be used in calculating Ec have been
selected to be those comprising the most linear portion of the
~Qh-versus-~D curve.  Patrick et al. (1985) chose to use the
criterion of linearity to define a range of ~Qh rather than the
~Qhmin procedure advocated by Heuze and Amadei (1985) because the
latter seemed to accept or reject data on a random basis and was
therefore ineffective.  The preceding paragraphs indicate that the mean
value of Et for the Grouse Canyon Member varies from 14.7 to 17.6 GPa,
depending on which choice of ~Qh data is made.  For the tests on the
Grouse Canyon Member, the data were no more or less linear using the
48-65.5 MPa pressure range than they were using the pressure range
determined using the ~Qhmin procedure.  Therefore, because a strong
case cannot be made for preferential use of either the criterion of
linearity or the ~Qhmin procedure to select the appropriate range of
~Qh, the conclusion is made that the mean value of Et lies in the
range of 14.7 to 17.6 GPa.
