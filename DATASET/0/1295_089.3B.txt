			45,000 to 35,000 Years Before Present

  Four finite-age macrofossil assemblages from the northern Mojave Desert
are older than 35,000 B.P. (fig. 14). The three from the Eleana Range-3
midden provide the oldest time series from a single site in the Southwest.
The ER-3(7)2 assemblage is associated with two radiocarbon dates with a
weighted average of 45,000~~900 B.P. (Long and Rippeteau, 1974) (table 6).
It indicates vegetation broadly similar to today's: An open woodland of
Utah juniper and mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), with well-
developed stands of sagebrush (figs. 15, 16). Limber pine, the dominant
tree during the succeeding full glacial, is absent from the ER-3(7)2 sample,
as are many of the plants present today (such as Pinus monophylla, Quercus
gambelii, Rhus trilobata, and Atriplex canescens).
  Based on the ER-3(7)2 macrofossil assemblage, precipitation at about
45,000 B.P. is inferred to have been no higher than the present values of
roughly 185 to 205 mm/yr-1 (table 5). Affinity of the fossil flora to
present northern steppe and dry woodland suggests that a smaller proportion
of precipitation fell during the summer (less than 10 percent as opposed to
the present value of about 25 percent). Absence of thermophilous species,
such as saltbushes (Atriplex spp.), hopsage (Grayia spinosa), and appreciable
quantities of pricklypear (Opuntia spp.) from the ER-3(7)2 sample implies an
average annual temperature 1~ to 3~C lower than at present (table 5).
