A.2.4.2.5  Parameters for Atmospheric Dispersion Calculations

Pending further meteorological data acquisition, parameters used for
atmospheric dispersion calculations shall be determined using methodologies
presented in NRC Regulatory Guide 1.111, "Methods for Estimating Atmospheric
Transport and Dispersion of Gaseous Effluents in Routine Releases from
Light-Water-Cooled Reactors," and 1.145, "Atmospheric Dispersion Models for
Potential Accident Consequence Assessments at Nuclear Power Plants."
