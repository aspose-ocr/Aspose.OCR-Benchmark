  543.790 County ordinance dissolving district; notice. Whenever a
majority of the members of the board of county commissioners of any
such county deem it to be in the best interests of the county and of the
district that any such district be dissolved, it shall so determine by ordi-
nance, after there is first found and determined and recited in such
ordinance that all outstanding indebtedness and bonds of all kinds of
the district have been paid. The county clerk shall thereupon certify a

notice by publication of:
  1. The adoption of such ordinance;
  2. The determination of the board of county commissioners that
the district should be dissolved; and

  2. If, at or before the time fixed by the ordinance and notice, writ-
ten protest shall be filed signed by 51 percent or more of the taxpaying
electors within the district, the district shall not be dissolved. If any
written protests are filed and the board of county commissioners deter-
mines that the protests so filed represent less than 51 percent of the
taxpaying electors of the district, the board may, if it so determines,
complete the dissolution by the adoption of a final ordinance of disso-
lution, which ordinance shall contain a recital as to the percentage of
protests, and such recital shall be binding and conclusive for all pur-
poses.
