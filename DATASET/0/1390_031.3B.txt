   This comparison also indicates the high degree of axisymmetry of
the thermal field. This fact is important in later sections where
correlations with an assumed axisymmetric theoretical model are made
and suggests that thermal conductivity of bedded salt may be isotropic.

2. Comparison of the Corrosion of Stainless Steel and Inconel 600
   Thermocouple Sheaths in the Heated Salt Block Environment

   After the heater was shut off in the Salt Block I experiment,
several stainless steel and Inconel 600 sheaths were examined. There
was no obvious corrosion of either material.

3. Stressmeter Results

   It was found that the initial "preload" of the stressmeters during
this test could not be maintained. In particular, at 500 W input and
10 days into the test, all the stressmeters were for all practical
purposes released due to thermal expansion of the salt. Use of this
rigid inclusion-type stressmeter is therefore not recommended in future
experiments of this type. Inclusion of the stressmeters did, however,
provide temperature behavior of the instrumentation at zero stress
levels.

E. Corrosion Coupons

   The corrosivity of several metal coupons was tested during the
Salt Block I experiment as part of the corrosion program for identifying
suitable materials for use in WIPP environments. One important problem
in the materials selection process is the definition of the environment,
and, in particular, the migration of brine inclusions in heated salt.

   Coupons were made from 12 candidate alloys, representing a wide
range of available materials. Included were the following:

   1. Titanium.
   2. Titanium-6V-4A1.
   3. Hastelloy C-276.
