DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 

1996 
HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT 

The Highway Department had a very productive year in 
1996. Greenville Road, Nutting Hill, Rousseau Hill and Old 
Mason Center Road were shimmed and sealed, Rousseau 
Heights was sealed. We had over 30 winter storm incidences, 
and used over 500 yards of sand, and 260 tons of salt. 

The University of New Hampshire Technology Transfer 
Center was contracted to survey and analyze the roads in 
Greenville. The result of this survey was that twenty two 
percent of Greenville's paved local roads need rehabilitation or 
reconstruction. Many miles of other paved and aggregate roads 
require routine and preventative maintenance which should be 
done before they deteriorate to poor conditions. The current 
capital improvements and road maintenance budgets are 
inadequate to meet these needs. The Town roads are 
deteriorating more quickly than Greenville's highway 
department can maintain and reconstruct them. The public is 
expressing dissatisfaction about the situation. 

SEWER DEPARTMENT 

The Sewer Department is in the process of completing 
the upgrade of the aeration system. This system will replace the 
mechanical aerators that were installed in 1976. with a diffused 
air system. This new system will enable us to run a more 
efficient process. Our facility processed 51 million gallons of 
waste water in 1996. We are presently receiving approximately 
50% from the GEVD. The project was partially substantially 
completed in 1996, and will resume in the spring of 1997. 

WATER DEPARTMENT 

We thank the water users from the Town of Greenville 
for their efforts in completing the income survey which resulted 
in the Town of Greenville being awarded a CDBG grant for
