thick) directly below the HU was changed from 0.74 to 1.50 W/m-~C at t = 0.175
days and then back to 0.74 at 1.0 day. Thermal conductivities were assumed
for the crushed tuff for dry and wet conditions. This was a simulation of
water filling the crushed tuff for this period and changing the thermal
conductivity from dry to saturated and then back to dry. Heat capacities were
not changed from the original computer run to simplify the calculations.
Changing of the heat capacity of the crushed tuff would tend to depress any
temperature changes further. Figure 8.1.3 shows that the predicted tempera-
ture at the bottom of the heater dropped significantly during these changes
and then returned to its original pattern soon afterwards. This pattern is
very similar to the heater surface measurements shown in Figure 8.1.2. This
calculation shows that the HU surface temperature was very sensitive to the
conductivity of the nearby tuff and appears to explain the behavior observed
in the temperature history analyses.

8.2 Phase I -- Nonwelded Tuff

8.2.1 Objectives of Section

  Section 8.2 provides information and data for the water level sensors for
the phase I testing  in nonwelded tuff. The objectives of this section are to
(1) present the measurement details and (2) provide sensor histories.

8.2.2 Measurement Details

  Only the bottom seven water level sensors were activated for this
experiment. Experience in testing in welded tuff indicated that the sensors
