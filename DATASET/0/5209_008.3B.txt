bedded ash-fall tuffs have the lowest apparent resistivities, ash-flow tuff
apparent resistivities increase as welding increases, and rhyolitic lava flows
with very little porosity have high apparent resistivities.
  As alteration (devitrification, zeolitization, and argillization) increases,
apparent resistivities decrease in any of the volcanic rocks.
  Caliper logs often discriminate between different lithologies. Soft, vitric ash-
fall tuffs and vitric flow rocks tend to cave as do highly fractured flow rocks.
Well-indurated, altered, ash-fall tuffs and slightly fractured devitrified flow
rocks tend not to cave. The geologist must have drill cuttings and core before
he finally decides as to the lithology, but electric logs and caliper logs can
augment rock identification which may be based on sketchy cutting returns.
