These experiments were conducted so that field-scale data and information 
would be available early in repository evaluations and the results could be 
used to guide later model validation efforts essential to predictive efforts 
for repository developments.  A focus for the testing was to conduct relatively 
short time experiments ( 36 days) on the very near field scale (0.3 m3) to    
evaluate thermal models that could be used in long time repository       
applications.

A single heater (10.2-cm-dia) was used in all three experiments in holes    
12.7 cm in dia.  Steady-state power was applied over a 1.2-m length in holes 
ranging from 2.4 to 3.2 m deep.  Power levels were set to scale heat fluxes 
representative of commercial high-level waste canisters.  Actual power levels 
selected ranged from 400 to 1200 W.  The heater was oriented vertically for 
two experiments and horizontally for the third.  Experiments with the vertical 
orientation were conducted in fractured welded tuff and unfractured nonwelded 
tuff; the experiment with horizontal orientation was conducted in the fractured 
welded tuff.  (Fractures in welded tuff in G-Tunnel have a predominate vertical 
dip.)

The major focus of the experiments was on evaluating applications of 
numerical models emphasizing thermal properties.  A thermal model was compared 
with the results of three experiments in tuffs; the welded and nonwelded tuffs 
had porosities ranging from 15% to 46%.  The essential conclusion was:

(1) a thermal model based on empirical heat transfer quantities (thermal
    conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, thermal radiation) derived
