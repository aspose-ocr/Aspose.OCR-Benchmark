strength values reported are averages of the two samples from each original
unless otherwise stated.

				APPENDIX E

		PROCEDURE FOR DENSITY AND POROSITY DETERMINATIONS

I.	PURPOSE
	The purpose of these tests is to measure the bulk density and connected
porosity of rock samples.

II.	EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURE
	Equipment consists of an analytical balance (Metler model H31AR). This
balance shall be calibrated in accordance with the requirements of QMI 9-1 of
the Quality Assurance Manual.
	Porosity and bulk density measurements will be performed as follows:
	Evacuate specimen under fore-pump vacuum for at least 24 h.
	Weigh in air (WDD).
	Evaculate in bell jar fitted with H2O access. Use fore-pump vacuum.
	Cover with deionized H2O and release to atmospheric pressure.
	Without removing sample from water, weigh submerged. Take tare and
	buoyance of any supports into account (WSS).
	Measure temperature of water.
	Remove sample from water and gently blot the surface with paper
	towel.
	Weigh in air (WSD).

III.	DATA ANALYSIS
	Data will be analyzed as follows:
		Calculate "grain density,"
