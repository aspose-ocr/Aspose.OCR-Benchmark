July: The summer reading program was held on Tuesday 

evenings. Both parents and children participated in 
the very successful program. 

August: August was the month for collecting overdue books. 

Overdue books are an ongoing problem. Please 
return all books when due so that everyone may have 
a chance to enjoy them. The library does not charge 
fines for overdue books. A book drop is located 
outside the library for the convenience of our 
patrons. 

September: Pre-school story time was held under the leadership 
of Karen Brouillette and Kathy Caron. Crafts, music, 
and stories were offered to the pre-schoolers and 
enjoyed by all. 

October: The first annual Harvest Fair was held at the 

Greenville Elementary School. Rebecca Goldsby 
coordinated the fund raiser. The proceeds were used 
by the library to purchase a TV and VCR. 

November: The library held a series of after school Multicultural 
sessions for grades 1 through 5. Ann Soini led a 
basket making workshop for the participants. 

December: A "Holiday Crafts for Children" program was held in 
the library, with great success. The first Christmas 
Cookie Swap was also held this month, with great 
cookies and receipes shared by all. 

In closing, the library wishes to thank all who generously shared 
their time, talents, and funds with us this past year. We look 
forward to continuing this relationship in 1997. 

Respectfully submitted, 



Dorothy T. Turtle, Library Director
