Effects of Future Pluvial-Related Rise in Water Table on the Suitability
of the Nevada Test Site as a Radioactive Waste Repository

  The return of a pluvial climate to the Southwest, say a thousand years
hence, might affect the isolation of HLW or TRU wastes buried at the NTS in
three ways. First, a major rise in water table (more correctly in the potentio-
metric level) might result in a significantly reduced distance of ground-water
flow from the NTS to points of natural discharge. Second, the utility
of the unsaturated zone (that is the volume of rock between the land surface and
the water table) as a waste disposal environment might be reduced. Third, an
increase in recharge during the pluvials would be accompanied by an increase in
ground-water velocity, and hence by shorter residence times for any dissolved
radionuclides. These matters are discussed in turn below.
  The possible effects of water table rise, in response to past (or future)
climate, on ground-water path length are illustrated by figure 2. This figure
shows diagrammatically the flow of water in the lower carbonate aquifer
between Frenchman Flat and the Ash Meadows discharge area and the influence of
hypothesized changes of water table altitude. If past (or future) pluvial con-
ditions raised the water table 40 to 50 m, or to an altitude of 760 to 770 m,
water could discharge from the lower carbonate aquifer at point A (Fig. 2),
about 14 km closer to Frenchman Flat than is Ash Meadows; a past (or future)
rise of 150 m, to an altitude of about 870 m, could result in natural discharge
from aquifer outcrops at point B, 21 km closer to Frenchman Flat. Not only would
such rises in water table result in shortening of the flow path, but the reduced
depth to water would increase the likelihood that the lower carbonate aquifer
might be tapped for water supply in the future in the region between Ash Meadows
and Frenchman Flat.
