PART 11.
OUT on THE DEP'ms.

“ Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
I might weep day and night for the slain of my people.”

A book has been written and published in Japan, its title “ Niku Dan
translated into English, reads, “ Human Bullets. ” This little book, a
narrative of the siege of Port Arthur, after being read through the length
and breadth of the empire, found translators to translate it into the best
known oflanguages; and its young author, himself an acto1 in the siege,
was summoned to the presence of his sovereign to be thanked and p1aised.
The book IS a graphic narrative ofthe most terrible siege in history, wherein
is vividly portrayed the deadly struggle of the besiegers. It contains as an
acknowledgement of its merit, a page 011 which23 is recorded the lield
Marshal s appreciation, and another page bearing the Commanding General’ 5 -
commendation.

In simple narrative the author carries the reader through appalling
scenes of horror, and as we read we are made to zealize the Dslaughter of
the enemy’s machine guns, of their ground- mines, electr1c w1re entangle-
ments, and exploding shells; we are made to hear the roar of the artillery
ﬁre dealing death and destruction, and there rises before us the mental vision
of the ﬁerce hand to hand conflict, and the dead and dying lying thickly in
the dark ravine.

“ For hill and battle plain,
\Vith dying men and slain,
Grew mountain heights of pain,
And mine is boundless woe.”

lhe <Trim wairior who stormed and took the most imp1ef1nable fortress
in the world gives expression to his feelings 011 his own crreat achievement,
in saddest words.

“And mine is boundless woe,”

Per the grim warrior' 5 heart 15 cleft 111 twain for the human bullets that
undet his command hurled themselves to their death.
